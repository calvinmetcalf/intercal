This is a multibranch repository that captures as much as we can find
and reconstruct of the history of C-INTERCAL. The history is not complete
because the project (begun in 1990) predates systematic use of version
control (and, indeed, any but the most primitive version-control systems). 

This repository stitches together some early RCS history up to 2003
kept by Eric S. Raymond (esr), a large collection of release tarballs, and
some snapshots and darcs history after 2003 kept by Alex Smith (ais523).

The main branch begins with the first public release, 0.3, from 1990.
Then it includes 0.5, 0.12, 0.13 and all of esr's mainline work up
to 0.24 in 2003.  The main branch continues with ais523's 0.25 
and later releases until 2010.  After the release 29 beta, the
main branch is esr's and ais523's merged code.

The resolution of preserved history between releases varies a great
deal.  In the original mainline, esr gradually began putting the
project under RCS control in mid-1996, just before 0.14.  All changes
in the website directory were being tracked between about 0.18 and
0.24, but some source files had not yet been RCSed.  Development from
0.24 through 0.28 is recorded only by public release tarballs and
sporadic backups.  Development after 0.28 to the 0.29 beta and after
that until the creation of this unified repo was recorded in a darcs
archive.

In August 2010 esr stitched all this information together into a
unified repository, which you are looking at now.  Metainformation
such as commit dates and authorship has been preserved. Both esr and
ais23 will be using this repository as a basis for further development.

There is a 'dos' branch that holds William W. Patterson's DOS port of 0.15.

There is a 'thick' branch that contains Malcolm Ryan's Threaded
INTERCAL version forked from 0.17. The language extensions in Threaded
INTERCAL were merged into the mainline after 0.24, so the thick code 
itself is only of historical interest.

We are missing early mainline releases 0.4, 0.6-0.11, and 0.14; so
far, diligent searches of even the mustiest web and FTP archives have
failed to turn these up.  If you can supply these, please inform the
maintainers.
