Sorry, but I couldn't find the (1910)-routine so I wrote one, which
will do it's job, IF the (1900)-routine is as the manual says ( you know
it isn't ). At least I hope it works because the manual is not very clear
about this routine.


(1910) PLEASE STASH .3 + :3 + :1 + :2
       DO :1 <- #32768
       PLEASE .2 <- #1
       PLEASE (1911) NEXT
(1911) DO FORGET #1
       DO STASH .1
       DO (1900) NEXT
       PLEASE :2 <- .1
       DO RETRIEVE .1
       DO (1500) NEXT
       PLEASE DO :1 <- :3
       DO (1010) NEXT
       PLEASE .1 <- .3
       DO (1912) NEXT
       DO (1911) NEXT
(1912) PLEASE (1913) NEXT
       DO .2 <- :1~'#65280$#65280'
       PLEASE RETRIEVE :2 + .3 + :1 + :3
       DO RESUME #2
(1914) PLEASE RESUME #1$"'.1~.1'~#1"
(1913) PLEASE (1914) NEXT
