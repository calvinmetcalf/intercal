Fine. You've asked for it, you'll get it. Here it is, 1,000,000 Hail-Mary's
in TriIntercal, which is of course a much better language for this
than ML.

BTW, there appears to be an anomaly in READING OUT tail variables, since
the READ OUT does a bit reversal instead of (as one might expect in
TriIntercal) a trit reversal.

Helpful hint: before you run this through ick, change the loop constants
to something sensible. Finding the loop constants is left as an exercise
to the reader :)

Helpful hint 2: This would not very likely be a winning ICICC entry :)

Have fun,
