# Name
#    coopt.sh -- an inefficient optimizer that can produce very efficient
#                code
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    This optimizer is only run on noninteractive code that takes no
#    output. (It's designed to run on executables produced by INTERCAL
#    code, but will run on other executables that support the +mystery
#    option). It optimizes the file by replacing it by one that simply
#    produces the required output! Therefore, it creates fast but
#    inefficient code. If the file to be optimized hits an error or
#    is terminated by +mystery, then no changes are made.
