/* lose.h --- error message strings */

/*
 * Note: these error message texts, with one exception, are direct from 
 * the Princeton compiler (INTERCAL-72) sources (transmitted by Don Woods).
 * The one exception is E632, which in INTERCAL-72 had the error message
 *	PROGRAM ATTEMPTED TO EXIT WITHOUT ERROR MESSAGE
 * ESR's "THE NEXT STACK HAS RUPTURED!..." has been retained on the grounds
 * that it is more obscure and much funnier.  For context, find a copy of
 * Joe Haldeman's SF short story "A !Tangled Web", first published in 
 * Analog magazine sometime in 1983 and later anthologized in the author's
 * "Infinite Dreams" (Ace 1985).
