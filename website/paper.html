<p><tt>"<em>And remember, when you look into the pit, the pit looks
back into you.</em>"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-- Anonymous
INTERCAL hacker</tt></p>

<p><tt>On May 26, 1972, two students at Princeton University took
the programming community if not by storm, at least by mild
sprinkle when they released INTERCAL[<a href="#note1">1</a>]. They
were summarily dismissed from Princeton and forced to flee to a
small banana republic where they refine the finer points of the
language on political prisoners. This is, of course, strictly
against the Geneva Convention, but as you will see, INTERCAL
strives to be an unconventional language.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Eighteen years later, while suffering from a paralytic
attack of ennui, the Mad Malvernite J. Lapin perpetrated a hack of
untold consequences upon the world by rereleasing INTERCAL under
UN*X, which he renamed C-INTERCAL. Unfortunately, J. Lapin appears
to be a pseudonym, so nobody can determine upon whose shoulders the
blame should rest for such malfeasance. However, some people
suspect that the rerelease of INTERCAL heralds the time when the
Old Ones shall wake from their sleep deep beneath the sea and shall
rule over the earth for 2^32 years, befuddling men's minds and
forcing them to use buggy overpriced software[<a
href="#note2">2</a>].</tt></p>

<p><tt>But I'm not here to talk about eschatology, I'm here to talk
about modularity and abstraction. Well, believe me, you couldn't
have designed a language more abstract than INTERCAL. To begin
with, one of the most important aspects of abstraction is
information hiding. Information hiding is a time honoured tradition
of computer programmers, although sometimes it goes by its other
name, "job security". The idea is to make your code as obscure as
possible, hiding any possible information, so your employer
couldn't fire you and hire some junior birdman mailboy to maintain
your code. INTERCAL doesn't only hide information it actively
distorts it. For example, the easiest way to store the value of
65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>DO:1&lt;-#0$#256</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>If that's the easiest way, imagine the power at your
fingertips if you're trying to be deliberately obscure! To further
demonstrate, if you were to write a program in INTERCAL which reads
in 32-bit unsigned integers, treats them as signed 2's complement
numbers, and prints out their absolute values, it would take about
22 lines of code and between 15 and 30 minutes to write, whereas
the same program could be written in a single line of SNOBOL or APL
requiring about a minute to write both[<a href="#note3">3</a>]. So
not only does INTERCAL allow the programmer to generate twenty
times as much code as most other languages, making the programmer
appear much more productive than his colleagues forced to program
in a terse language, an INTERCAL program also takes much longer to
write, allowing for more Quake-breaks. And as an added bonus, when
the programmer is done, the information is so cleverly hidden that
not even Sparky the Wonder Dog could find it, and she can find
gravy in a cesspool! This allows the programmer to take even more
Quake-breaks, as management doesn't dare fire such an important
asset to the company.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In addition to information hiding, multinational support is
also an important part of abstraction. As information exchange
causes the globe to shrink,[<a href="#note4">4</a>] it's important
that programming languages are able to support a wide variety of
different cultures. To that end, INTERCAL took the obvious step.
Since the number systems of different countries are different from
other different countries where the relationship between the
different countries can be symmetric or transitive, it cannot, for
obvious reasons, be reflexive, INTERCAL has implemented a different
number system. Instead of using numerals, all input is done by
typing in the name of the number. For example, if you wanted to
feed the value of 523 to an INTERCAL program, the input would look
like "FIVE TWO THREE."[<a href="#note5">5</a>] Additionally,
INTERCAL will also accept the value of OH for zero and NINER for 9.
Recognising that INTERCAL would have multicultural scope, the
implementors implemented number support for input digits in
Sanskrit, Basque, Tagalog, Classical Nahuatl, Georgian, Kwakiutl,
and Volapuk.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Until the new INTERCAL compiler with better RYM[<a
href="#note6">6</a>] access comes out, the old compiler has no way
of knowing which language you are familiar with and thus it doesn't
know what language to produce its output in[<a
href="#note7">7</a>]. INTERCAL elegantly solves this problem by
producing its output in Roman numerals, under the assumption that
when Rome was at the height of its strength, half the world was
under its dominion, so the comprehension of Roman numerals is part
of our racial memory.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In addition to being a versatile and truly international
language, INTERCAL is also very simple. For example, in most
languages the logical operators AND, OR, and XOR are binary, i.e.,
they require two operands to operate on. In INTERCAL, AND, OR, and
XOR are unary operators, thereby halving the potential for
pernicious logical errors. AND is represented by the ampersand
(&amp;), OR by the inverted, baseless isoceles triangle (V) and XOR
by the what[<a href="#note8">8</a>] (?). The way the unary
operators work is to perform the required operation on adjacent
bits in the variable. Thus, #&amp;77 (binary = 1001101) is binary
0000000000000100 = 4, #V77 is binary 1000000001101111 = 32879, and
#?77 is binary 1000000001101011 = 32875.[<a
href="#note9">9</a>]</tt></p>

<p><tt>Ever since Dijkstra's seminal paper "Use of GOTO Considered
Harmful" was published in Communications of the ACM, there has been
a hue and cry against the use of GOTO. INTERCAL recognises the
importance of structured programming and rebukes the GOTO, saying
<em>retro me iad</em>[<a href="#note10">10</a>]. In fact, the
implementors of INTERCAL feel so strongly about the poor
programming habits that GOTO encourages, that they implemented
GOTO's opposite number, COME FROM. Thus if you had a program which
looked similar to below:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>(1) PLEASE &lt;YOUR STATEMENT HERE&gt;<br />
</tt> 

<blockquote>.<br />
 .<br />
 .</blockquote>

<tt>(2) DO COME FROM (1)</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>anytime the program executed the statement at label 1, it
would immediately jump to the statement at label 2 without
executing any of the intervening statements. This is very difficult
to follow and requires considerable expertise to use correctly and
makes the code almost impossible to follow. That's right, baby --
information hiding.</tt></p>

<p><tt>One of the big changes to C that Stroustroup made when he
created C++ was the use of const data types, which kept the
programmer from inadvertently changing the values of variables
which shouldn't.[<a href="#note11">11</a>] The creators of INTERCAL
recognised the need for this way before Stroustroup became Mr.
Fancy Pants and so they put the IGNORE statement into the language.
Any variables or arrays named in a list following the DO IGNORE
directive will effectively become read-only. Their value can be
used in operations and assigned to other variables, but any attempt
to assign a value to a variable being IGNOREd will be met with a
contempt so profound that the compiler will pass over it in utter
silence. Of course, there may be a time when you want to cast away
the constancy of variable, and in that case, you would use the
REMEMBER directive. Any variable which is REMEMBERed will stay so
until it is IGNORED. Future versions of the language may have a
SNUB directive which when used upon a variable will cause it to
IGNORE any attempts to write to it, even if it is REMEMBERed. The
only way to make a SNUBbed variable writeable again is through the
use of the APOLOGIZE statement which has roughly a fifty percent
chance of working[<a href="#note12">12</a>]. The DON'T BE LIKE
THAT. YOU REMIND ME OF MY MOTHER statement is currently a valid
statement in INTERCAL though if used upon an IGNOREd variable will
not cause a change of state in that variable, i.e., it will still
be IGNOREd.[<a href="#note13">13</a>]</tt></p>

<p><tt>INTERCAL is not even vaguely modular and nothing I can say
would persuade you that it was.</tt></p>

<p><tt>INTERCAL is a very dynamic, constantly evolving[<a
href="#note14">14</a>] language which shows much promise for future
generations of programmers. With languages like Visual Basic and
Java out there which allow people who can hardly tie their shoes to
write complicated GUI WWW browsers, people will begin to think that
programmers aren't wizards and should be earning less than that
nice young man at the local fast food joint who asks them if they'd
like fries with that. Hmmm... as long as I have a couple of
paragraphs left, I may as well mention that INTERCAL is fully
portable, as the INTERCAL compiler first generates native C code
and then compiles that. The INTERCAL compiler, itself, is written
in C and is easily portable. There's even an INTERCAL major mode
for emacs which will help you maintain the proper balance of
PLEASE, DO, and PLEASE DO statements.[<a

[<a id="note4" name="note4">4</a>]It has been demonstrated that
information exchange causes the release of a virtual particle
called a metron. As the metron leaves the local system it was
originally a part of, the system shrinks by an arbitrary amount
which is directly proportional to the tightness of Tom Jones'
pants. As more and more information is exchanged, an increasing
number of metrons are released, and as Tom Jones' pants keep
getting tighter and tighter, the local system, in this case, the
planet, is shrinking without bound. What does this mean to you? Not
much, really. Actually, I'm kind of sorry I brought it up. Just

[<a id="note7" name="note7">7</a>]True, it could a) look at your

would require doubling the size of the system library which is
definitely the Wrong Thing and b) would require adding more to the
compiler which is definitely the Wrong Thing.<br />
