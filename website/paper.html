Abstraction and Modularity in INTERCAL<br>

"<em>And remember, when you look into the pit, the pit looks back into
you.</em>"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Anonymous INTERCAL hacker
<P>

On May 26, 1972, two students at Princeton University took the
programming community if not by storm, at least by mild sprinkle when
they released INTERCAL[<A HREF="#note1">1</A>]. They were summarily
dismissed from Princeton and forced to flee to a small banana republic
where they refine the finer points of the language on political
prisoners. This is, of course, strictly against the Geneva Convention,
but as you will see, INTERCAL strives to be an unconventional
language.
<P>
Eighteen years later, while suffering from a paralytic attack of
ennui, the Mad Malvernite J. Lapin perpetrated a hack of untold
consequences upon the world by rereleasing INTERCAL under UN*X, which
he renamed C-INTERCAL. Unfortunately, J. Lapin appears to be a
pseudonym, so nobody can determine upon whose shoulders the blame
should rest for such malfeasance. However, some people suspect that
the rerelease of INTERCAL heralds the time when the Old Ones shall
wake from their sleep deep beneath the sea and shall rule over the
earth for 2^32 years, befuddling men's minds and forcing them to use
buggy overpriced software[<A href="#note2">2</A>].
<P>
But I'm not here to talk about eschatology, I'm here to talk about
modularity and abstraction. Well, believe me, you couldn't have
designed a language more abstract than INTERCAL. To begin with, one of
the most important aspects of abstraction is information
hiding. Information hiding is a time honoured tradition of computer
programmers, although sometimes it goes by its other name, "job
security". The idea is to make your code as obscure as possible,
hiding any possible information, so your employer couldn't fire you
and hire some junior birdman mailboy to maintain your code. INTERCAL
doesn't only hide information it actively distorts it. For example,
the easiest way to store the value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL
variable is: <P><BLOCKQUOTE> DO:1&lt;-#0$#256
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If that's the easiest way, imagine the power at your fingertips if
you're trying to be deliberately obscure! To further demonstrate, if
you were to write a program in INTERCAL which reads in 32-bit unsigned
integers, treats them as signed 2's complement numbers, and prints out
their absolute values, it would take about 22 lines of code and
between 15 and 30 minutes to write, whereas the same program could be
written in a single line of SNOBOL or APL requiring about a minute to
write both[<A HREF="#note3">3</A>]. So not only does INTERCAL allow
the programmer to generate twenty times as much code as most other
languages, making the programmer appear much more productive than his
colleagues forced to program in a terse language, an INTERCAL program
also takes much longer to write, allowing for more Quake-breaks. And
as an added bonus, when the programmer is done, the information is so
cleverly hidden that not even Sparky the Wonder Dog could find it, and
she can find gravy in a cesspool! This allows the programmer to take
even more Quake-breaks, as management doesn't dare fire such an
important asset to the company.
<P>
In addition to information hiding, multinational support is also an
important part of abstraction. As information exchange causes the
globe to shrink,[<A HREF="#note4">4</A>] it's important that
programming languages are able to support a wide variety of different
cultures. To that end, INTERCAL took the obvious step. Since the
number systems of different countries are different from other
different countries where the relationship between the different
countries can be symmetric or transitive, it cannot, for obvious
reasons, be reflexive, INTERCAL has implemented a different number
system.  Instead of using numerals, all input is done by typing in the
name of the number.  For example, if you wanted to feed the value of
523 to an INTERCAL program, the input would look like "FIVE TWO
THREE."[<A HREF="#note5">5</A>] Additionally, INTERCAL will also
accept the value of OH for zero and NINER for 9. Recognising that
INTERCAL would have multicultural scope, the implementors implemented
number support for input digits in Sanskrit, Basque, Tagalog,
Classical Nahuatl, Georgian, Kwakiutl, and Volapuk.
<P>
Until the new INTERCAL compiler with better RYM[<A
HREF="#note6">6</A>] access comes out, the old compiler has no way of
knowing which language you are familiar with and thus it doesn't know
what language to produce its output in[<A
HREF="#note7">7</A>]. INTERCAL elegantly solves this problem by
producing its output in Roman numerals, under the assumption that when
Rome was at the height of its strength, half the world was under its
dominion, so the comprehension of Roman numerals is part of our racial
memory.
<P>
In addition to being a versatile and truly international language,
INTERCAL is also very simple. For example, in most languages the
logical operators AND, OR, and XOR are binary, i.e., they require two
operands to operate on. In INTERCAL, AND, OR, and XOR are unary
operators, thereby halving the potential for pernicious logical
errors. AND is represented by the ampersand (&amp;), OR by the
inverted, baseless isoceles triangle (V) and XOR by the what[<A
HREF="#note8">8</A>] (?). The way the unary operators work is to
perform the required operation on adjacent bits in the variable. Thus,
#&amp;77 (binary = 1001101) is binary 0000000000000100 = 4, #V77 is
binary 1000000001101111 = 32879, and #?77 is binary 1000000001101011 =
32875.[<A HREF="#note9">9</A>]
<P>
Ever since Dijkstra's seminal paper "Use of GOTO Considered Harmful"
was published in Communications of the ACM, there has been a hue and
cry against the use of GOTO. INTERCAL recognises the importance of
structured programming and rebukes the GOTO, saying <EM>retro me
iad</EM>[<A HREF="#note10">10</A>]. In fact, the implementors of
INTERCAL feel so strongly about the poor programming habits that GOTO
encourages, that they implemented GOTO's opposite number, COME
FROM. Thus if you had a program which looked similar to below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1)	PLEASE <YOUR STATEMENT HERE><BR> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
.<BR> 
.<BR> 
.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(2)	DO COME FROM (1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
anytime the program executed the statement at label 1, it would
immediately jump to the statement at label 2 without executing any of
the intervening statements.  This is very difficult to follow and
requires considerable expertise to use correctly and makes the code
almost impossible to follow. That's right, baby -- information hiding.
<P>
One of the big changes to C that Stroustroup made when he created C++
was the use of const data types, which kept the programmer from
inadvertently changing the values of variables which shouldn't.[<A
HREF="#note11">11</A>] The creators of INTERCAL recognised the need
for this way before Stroustroup became Mr. Fancy Pants and so they put
the IGNORE statement into the language. Any variables or arrays named
in a list following the DO IGNORE directive will effectively become
read-only. Their value can be used in operations and assigned to other
variables, but any attempt to assign a value to a variable being
IGNOREd will be met with a contempt so profound that the compiler will
pass over it in utter silence. Of course, there may be a time when you
want to cast away the constancy of variable, and in that case, you
would use the REMEMBER directive. Any variable which is REMEMBERed
will stay so until it is IGNORED. Future versions of the language may
have a SNUB directive which when used upon a variable will cause it to
IGNORE any attempts to write to it, even if it is REMEMBERed. The only
way to make a SNUBbed variable writeable again is through the use of
the APOLOGIZE statement which has roughly a fifty percent chance of
working[<A HREF="#note12">12</A>]. The DON'T BE LIKE THAT. YOU REMIND
ME OF MY MOTHER statement is currently a valid statement in INTERCAL
though if used upon an IGNOREd variable will not cause a change of
state in that variable, i.e., it will still be IGNOREd.[<A
HREF="#note13">13</A>]
<P>
INTERCAL is not even vaguely modular and nothing I can say would
persuade you that it was.<P> INTERCAL is a very dynamic, constantly
evolving[<A HREF="#note14">14</A>] language which shows much promise
for future generations of programmers. With languages like Visual
Basic and Java out there which allow people who can hardly tie their
shoes to write complicated GUI WWW browsers, people will begin to
think that programmers aren't wizards and should be earning less than
that nice young man at the local fast food joint who asks them if
they'd like fries with that.  Hmmm... as long as I have a couple of
paragraphs left, I may as well mention that INTERCAL is fully
portable, as the INTERCAL compiler first generates native C code and
then compiles that. The INTERCAL compiler, itself, is written in C and
is easily portable. There's even an INTERCAL major mode for emacs
which will help you maintain the proper balance of PLEASE, DO, and
PLEASE DO statements.[<A HREF="#note15">15</A>]

[<A NAME="note1">1</A>] which stands for "Compiler Language With No Pronouncable Acronym", obviously.<BR>
[<A NAME="note2">2</A>] There's a small sect of Billyites who, pointing to Microsoft, claim that this has already happened.<br>
[<A NAME="note3">3</A>]These examples shamelessly cribbed from THE INTERCAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE REVISED REFERENCE MANUAL, page 2.<br>
[<A NAME="note4">4</A>]It has been demonstrated that information exchange causes the release of a virtual particle called a metron. As the metron leaves the local system it was originally a part of, the system shrinks by an arbitrary amount which is directly proportional to the tightness of Tom Jones' pants. As more and more information is exchanged, an increasing number of metrons are released, and as Tom Jones' pants keep getting tighter and tighter, the local system, in this case, the planet, is shrinking without bound. What does this mean to you? Not much, really. Actually, I'm kind of sorry I brought it up. Just forget I mentioned it.<br>
[<A NAME="note5">5</A>]It might also look different, depending on the font your terminal uses.<br>
[<A NAME="note6">6</A>]Read Your Mind<br>
[<A NAME="note7">7</A>]True, it could a) look at your input and produce output that matches the language or b) you could include compiler directives mandating an output language. Well, a) would require doubling the size of the system library which is definitely the Wrong Thing and b) would require adding more to the compiler which is definitely the Wrong Thing.<br>
[<A NAME="note8">8</A>]Which due to the popularity of the movie, The Usual Suspects, may have its name changed to the "what the fuh", pending the creation of an ANSI committee to look into the matter, cubic cubits upon cubic cubits of jargonised deliberations interspersed with sheets of paper saying, "this page intensionally left blank", and at least one best selling pulp novelisation of the process written either by Jackie Collins or Donald Knuth (or both).<br>
[<A NAME="note9">9</A>]You may be wondering about the splat (#) in front of each number. That's good. It shows that you have a curious mind. However, I'm not going to tell you what it means. That's called "information hiding".<br>

[<A NAME="note13">13</A>]Incidentally, INTERCAL is fully compliant with the military's view of female officers and supports the DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T WANT IT, BABY statement.<br>
