<p>Beware! If you aren't a hard-core hacker, you'd best surf right
back where you came from <em>now</em>. Nothing but twisted
technical yuks and an inexorable descent into brain-sucking
obsession awaits beyond this point. <strong>You have been
warned.</strong></p>

<h1 class="c1">Abandon All Sanity, Ye Who Enter Here</h1>

<p>So, you think you've seen it all, eh?</p>

<p>OK. You've coded in C. You've hacked in LISP. Fortran and BASIC
hold no terrors for you. You write Emacs modes for fun. You eat
assemblers for breakfast. You're fluent in half a dozen languages
nobody but a handful of &uuml;bergeeks have ever heard of. You grok
TECO. Possibly you even know <i>&lt;shudder&gt;</i> COBOL.</p>

<p>Maybe you're ready for the ultimate challenge...INTERCAL.</p>

<p>INTERCAL. The language designed to be Turing-complete but as
fundamentally unlike any existing language as possible. Expressions
that look like line noise. Control constructs that will make you
gasp, make you laugh, and possibly make you hurl. Data structures?
We don't need no steenking data structures!</p>

<p>INTERCAL. Designed very early one May morning in 1972 by two
hackers who are still trying to live it down. Initially implemented
on an IBM 360 running batch SPITBOL. Described by a manual that
circulated for years after the short life of the first
implementation, reducing strong men to tears (of laughter). Revived
in 1990 by the C-INTERCAL compiler, and now the center of an
international community of technomasochists.</p>

<p>INTERCAL. Now you, too, can be a part of the madness.</p>

<p>Read what <a href="nelson.html">Ted Nelson</a> had to say...)</p>

<h1 class="c1">INTERCAL Resources</h1>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>You can download either a <a
href="intercal.ps.gz">Postscript</a> or <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/intercal.txt.gz">flat
text</a> version of the Revised INTERCAL Manual here. Postscript is
recommended, as the manual now includes figures and diagrams until
recently unseen by any but the small handful with paper copies.</p>

<h2>An INTERCAL paper</h2>

<p>Alexander Garrett wrote a <a href="paper.html">paper</a> on
INTERCAL for his Spring 1997 Programming Languages: Theory and
Design class. Alexander writes:</p>

<blockquote class="c2">The obvious choice was INTERCAL (I'm still
quite surprised that I'm the only one who picked it -- most people
did Java??). Anyway, it was not favourably received...when [the
professor] handed it back, he said, "Ah. I see you're someone with
a sense of humour. Unfortunately for you, I'm not."</blockquote>

<p>We have corrected two typos (misspellings of "Malvernite" and
"compiler") in this copy.</p>

<h2>Implementations</h2>

<p>You can download the latest version of the <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/intercal-0.23.tar.gz">C-INTERCAL
distribution</a> here (includes the manual and sample programs).
Requires either bison or yacc and flex or lex. Builds and runs
nicely under any ANSI/POSIX platform, including Linux and the free
BSD versions.</p>

<p>You can download a binary archive of William Walter Patterson's
<a href="ick15d12.zip">port of INTERCAL 0.15 for DOS</a>, which
finally has the programming language it truly deserves.</p>

<p>There is a Java implementation of INTERCAL with COME FROM -- see
the <a
href="http://studwww.ira.uka.de/~s_sperli/jintercal/">J-INTERCAL</a>
project page.</p>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>

<p>Jonathan Ferro has written an <a
href="calc-intercal.el">Intercal calculator mode</a> for Emacs.</p>

<p>You can find out more about Kevin Stock's implementation of <a
href="iperl.html">INTERCAL functions for PERL</a>.</p>

<p>Alexander Garrett has written a <a
href="http://www.demiurge.org/alex/computer/index.html">Java class
implementing the INTERCAL math library</a>.</p>

<h2>Home Pages</h2>

<p>Louis Howell, possibly the most accomplished C-INTERCAL hacker
not yet permanently institutionalized, has his own INTERCAL page,
<a href="http://www.webcom.com/nazgul/intercal.html">The
Pit</a>.</p>

<p>Brian Raiter, who edited the revised version of the INTERCAL
manual available in HTML above, maintains a good <a
href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal">INTERCAL
page</a>.</p>

<p>Jacob Mandelson also has an <a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~jlm/intercal.html">INTERCAL
Page</a>.</p>

<p>(The code from all of these home pages has been folded into the
INTERCAL distribution.)</p>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

<p>There is an <a
href="news:alt.lang.intercal">alt.lang.intercal</a> Usenet
newsgroup.</p>

<p>INTERCAL has even shown up once in the print media. Here's a
transcript of an <a href="stross.html">article by Charles
Stross.</a>.</p>

<h1>Extension Proposals</h1>

<p>There have been various proposals to extend INTERCAL to support
various trendy modern programming concepts. Of these, perhaps the
most impressively gaga is Malcolm Ryan's proposal for <a
href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/threaded_intercal.html">Threaded
Intercal</a>.</p>

<p>Andrew Arensburger is developing a proposal for <a
href="overloading.html">operand overloading</a> in INTERCAL.</p>

<p>The fine folks at <a href="http://www.assurdo.com/">Assurdo
Technologies</a> have released an INTERCAL implementation in Perl.
One of them writes ``[We're] gearing up for a manifesto. Our goal
is to position CLC-INTERCAL as the logical successor to Java.
(After all, it's faster, more functional, and provides better job
security for programmers!) But first we have to get the editor
environment (TECO) sorted out, write an ORB, and provide some
mechanism for generating XML (probably via custom obfuscated troff
macros).''</p>
