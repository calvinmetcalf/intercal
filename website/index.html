Beware! If you aren't a hard-core hacker, you'd best surf right back
where you came from <EM>now</EM>.  Nothing but twisted technical yuks
and an inexorable descent into brain-sucking obsession awaits beyond
this point. <B>You have been warned.</B>

<H1><CENTER>Abandon All Sanity, Ye Who Enter Here</CENTER></H1>

So, you think you've seen it all, eh? <P>

OK.  You've coded in C.  You've hacked in LISP.  Fortran and BASIC
hold no terrors for you.  You write Emacs modes for fun.  You eat
assemblers for breakfast.  You're fluent in half a dozen languages
nobody but a handful of &uuml;bergeeks have ever heard of.  You grok TECO.
Possibly you even know <I>&lt;shudder&gt;</I> COBOL. <P>

Maybe you're ready for the ultimate challenge...INTERCAL. <P>

INTERCAL.  The language designed to be Turing-complete but as
fundamentally unlike any existing language as possible.  Expressions
that look like line noise.  Control constracts that will make you
gasp, make you laugh, and possibly make you hurl.  Data structures?
We don't need no steenking data structures! <P>

INTERCAL.  Designed very early one May morning in 1972 by by two
hackers who are still trying to live it down.  Initially implemented
on an IBM 360 running batch SPITBOL.  Described by a manual that
circulated for years after the short life of the first implementation,
reducing strong men to tears (of laughter).  Revived in 1990 by the
C-INTERCAL compiler, and now the center of an international community
of technomasochists. <P>

INTERCAL.  Now you, too, can be a part of the madness. <P>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

You can download either a <A HREF="intercal.ps.gz">Postscript</A> or <A
HREF="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/intercal/intercal.txt.gz">flat text</A>
version of the Revised INTERCAL Manual here.  Postscript is
recommended, as the manual now includes figures and diagrams until
recently unseen by any but the small handful with paper copies. <P>

There's an slightly revised <A
HREF="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal-man/">HTML
version</A> of the INTERCAL manual created by Brian Raiter.  Eventually
this will probably be replaced by a version generated from the official
sources. <P>

<H2>Implementations</H2>

You can download the latest version of the <A
HREF="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/intercal-0.15.tar.gz"> C-INTERCAL
distribution</A> here (includes the manual and sample programs).
Requires either bison or yacc and flex or lex.  Builds and runs nicely
under any ANSI/POSIX platform, including Linux and the free BSD
versions.<P>

You can download a binary archive of William Walter Patterson's <A
HREF="ick15d12.zip">port of INTERCAL 0.15 for DOS</A>, which finally
has the programming language it truly deserves. <P>

You can find out more about Kevin Stock's implementation of <A
HREF="iperl.html">INTERCAL functions for PERL</A>.

<H2>Home Pages</H2>

Louis Howell, possibly the most accomplished C-INTERCAL hacker not yet
permanently institutionalized, has his own INTERCAL page, <A
HREF="http://www.webcom.com/nazgul/intercal.html"> The Pit</A>. <P>

Brian Raiter, who edited the revised version of the INTERCAL manual
available in HTML above, maintains a good
<A HREF="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal">INTERCAL page</A>. <P>

Jacob Mandelson also has an <A
HREF="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~jlm/intercal.html">INTERCAL
Page</A>. <P>

(The code from all of these home pages has been folded into the INTERCAL
distribution.) <P>

<H2>Other Resources</H2>

There is an <A HREF="news:alt.lang.intercal">alt.lang.intercal</A>
Usenet newsgroup. <P>

INTERCAL has even shown up once in the print media.  Here's a
transcript of an <A HREF="stross.html">article by Charles Stross.</A>,

If INTERCAL interests you, you may want to check out the <A

maintains a large collection of freeware you may find stimulating. <P>
