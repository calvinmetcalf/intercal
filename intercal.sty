% VERBATIM FILE LISTING

% --- The macros are based on those distributed with Sunil Podar's
% --- `EPIC.STY' macro package, attributed to Tim Morgan,
% --- modified to keep internal macros internal by Adrian F. Clark,
% --- alien@uk.ac.essex.ese
% --- ---and further latexification by Chris Rowley,
% --- ca_rowley@uk.ac.open.acs.vax.
% And finally, ever-so-slightly modified for INTERCAL by Michael Ernst.
