.H 1 "INTRODUCTION"
.P
The names you are about to ignore are true. However, the story has been changed
significantly. Any resemblance of the programming language portrayed here
to other programming languages, living or dead, is purely coincidental.
.H 2 "Origin and Purpose"
.P
The INTERCAL programming language was designed the morning of May 26, 1972
by Donald R. Woods and James M. Lyon, at Princeton University. Exactly when
in the morning will become apparent in the course of this manual. 
.ie '\*c'y' \{\
.P
Eighteen years later (give or take a few months) Eric S. Raymond perpetrated
a UNIX-hosted INTERCAL compiler as a weekend hack.  The C-INTERCAL
implementation has since been maintained and extended by an international
community of technomasochists, including Louis Howell, Steve Swales,
Michael Ernst, and Brian Raiter.
.P
(There was evidently an Atari implementation sometime between these
two; notes on it got appended to the INTERCAL-72 manual.  The culprits
have sensibly declined to identify themselves.)
.P
INTERCAL \}
.el It
was inspired by one ambition: to have a compiler language which has nothing at 
all in common with any other major language. By 'major' was meant anything
with which the authors were at all familiar, e.g., FORTRAN, BASIC, COBOL,
ALGOL, SNOBOL, SPITBOL, FOCAL, SOLVE, TEACH, APL, LISP, and PL/I. For the
most part, INTERCAL has remained true to this goal, sharing only the basic
elements such as variables, arrays, and the ability to do I/O, and eschewing 
all conventional operations other than the assignment statement (FORTRAN
"=").
.H 2 "Acronym"
.P
The full name of the compiler is "Compiler Language With No Pronounceable
Acronym", which is, for obvious reasons, abbreviated "INTERCAL".
.H 2 "Acknowledgments"
.P
The authors are deeply indebted to Eric M. Van and Daniel J. Warmenhoven,
without whose unwitting assistance this manual would still have been
possible.
.H 1 "FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS"
.P
In this section an attempt is made to describe how and why INTERCAL may be
used; i.e., what it is like and what it is good for.
.H 2 "Sample Program"
.SETR example1
.P
Shown below is a relatively simple INTERCAL program which will read in 32-bit
unsigned integers, treat them as signed, 2's-complement numbers, and print out 
their absolute values. The program exits if the absolute value is zero. Note
in particular the inversion routine (statements 6 through 14), which could
be greatly simplified if the subroutine library (see section
.GETHN sublib
) were used.
.P
A more detailed analysis of a program is made in section 
.GETHN proghints
 of this manual.

.H 2 "Uses for INTERCAL"
.P
INTERCAL's main advantage over other programming languages is its strict
simplicity. It has few capabilities, and thus there are few restrictions to
be kept in mind. Since it is an exceedingly easy language to learn, one
might expect it would be a good language for initiating novice programmers.
Perhaps surprising, than, is the fact that it would be more likely to
initiate a novice into a search for another line of work. As it turns out,
INTERCAL is more useful (which isn't saying much) as a challenge to
professional programmers.  Those who doubt this need only refer back to the
sample program in section
.GETHN example1
\&. This 22-statement program took somewhere
from 15 to 30 minutes to write, whereas the same objectives can be achieved
by single-statement programs in either SNOBOL;
.DS L
        PLEASE INPUT POS(0) ('-' ! '')
        + (SPAN('0123456789') $ OUTPUT)
        + *NE(OUTPUT) :S(PLEASE)F(END)
.DE
or APL;
.DS L
        [1] \(->0\(!=\(sq\(<-\(or\(sq
.DE
Admittedly, neither of these is likely to appear more intelligible to
anyone unfamiliar with the languages involved, but they took roughly 60
seconds and 15 seconds, respectively, to write. Such is the overwhelming
power of INTERCAL!
.P
The other major importance of INTERCAL lies in its seemingly inexhaustible
capacity for amazing one's fellow programmers, confounding programming shop
managers, winning friends, and influencing people. It is a well-known and
oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held
in high esteem. For example, if one were to state that the simplest way to
store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:
.DS L
        DO :1 <- #0\*(ct#256
.DE
any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd. Since this is
indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish in
front of his boss, who would of course happened to turn up, as bosses are
wont to do. The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer
having been correct.
.H 1 "DESCRIPTION"
.P
The examples of INTERCAL programming which have appeared in the preceding
sections of this manual have probably seemed highly esoteric to the reader
unfamiliar with the language. With the aim of making them more so, we
present here a description of INTERCAL.
.H 2 "Variables"
.P
INTERCAL allows only 2 different types of variables, the
.B "16-bit integer"
and the
.B "32-bit integer."
These are represented by a spot (.) or two-spot
(:), respectively, followed by any number between 1 and 65535, inclusive.
These variables may contain only non-negative numbers; thus they have the
respective ranges of values: 0 to 65535 and 0 to 4294967295. Note: .123 and
:123 are two distinct variables. On the other hand, .1 and .0001 are
identical.  Furthermore, the latter may NOT be written as 1E-3.
.H 2 "Constants"
.P
.B Constants
are 16-bit values only and may range from 0 to 65535. They are
prefixed by a mesh (#). Caution! Under no circumstances confuse the mesh
with the interleave operator, except under confusing circumstances!
.H 2 "Arrays"
.P
.B Arrays
are represented by a tail (,) for 16-bit values, or a hybrid (;) for
32-bit values, followed by a number between 1 and 65535, inclusive. The
number is suffixed by the word SUB, followed by the subscripts, separated
optionally by spaces. Subscripts may be any expressions, including those
involving subscripted variables. This occasionally leads to ambiguous
constructions, which are resolved as discussed in section 
.GETHN precedence
\&.  Definition
of array dimensions will be discussed later in greater detail, since
discussing it in less detail would be difficult. As before, ,123 and ;123
are distinct.  In summary, .123, :123, #123, ,123, and :123 are all
distinct.
.H 2 "Operators"
.P
INTERCAL recognizes 5 operators -- 2 binary and 3 unary. Please be kind to 
our operators: they may not be very intelligent, but they're all we've got.
In a sense, all 5 operators are binary, as they are all bit-oriented, but
it is not our purpose here to quibble about bits of trivia.
.H 3 "Binary Operators"
.P
The binary operators are \fBinterleave\fR (also called \fBmingle\fR)
and \fBselect\fR, which
are represented by a change (\*(ct) and a sqiggle [sic] (~), respectively.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
(In C-INTERCAL'S ASCII environment, EBCDIC \*(ct is replaced by a big
money ($).) \}
.P
The interleave operator takes two 16-bit values and produces a 32-bit result
by alternating the bits of the operands. Thus, #65535\*(ct#0 has the 32-bit
binary form 101010....10 or 2863311530 decimal, while #0\*(ct#65535 = 
0101....01 binary = 1431655765 decimal, and #255\*(ct#255 is equivalent to
#65535.
.P
The select operator takes from the first operand whichever bits correspond
to 1's in the second operand, and packs these bits to the right in the result.
Both operands are automatically padded on the left with zeros to 32 bits
before the selection takes place, so the variable types are unrestricted.
If more than 16 bits are selected, the result is a 32-bit value, otherwise
it is a 16-bit value. For example, #179~#201 (binary value 10110011~11001001)
selects from the first argument the 8th, 7th, 4th, and 1st from last bits,
namely, 1001, which = 9. But #201~#179 selects from binary 11001001 the 8th,
6th, 5th, 2nd, and 1st from last bits, giving 10001 = 17. #179~#179 has the
value 31, while #201~#201 has the value 15.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.H 4 "Return type of SELECT"
.P
INTERCAL-72 defined the return type of a SELECT operation
to depend on the number of bits SELECTed.  The C-INTERCAL compiler
takes the easier route of defining the return type to be that of
the right operand, independent of its actual value.  This form has
the advantage that all types can be determined at compile time.
Putting in run time type checking would add significant overhead and
complication, to effect a very minor change in language semantics.
.P
The only time this distinction makes any difference is when a unary
operator is applied to the SELECT result.  This happens extremely
rarely in practice, the only known instance being the 32-bit
greater-than test in the standard library, where an XOR operator is
applied to the result of SELECTing a number against itself.  The
INTERCAL-72 authors first SELECT the result against #65535\*(ct#65535 to
insure that XOR sees a 32-bit value.  With the current compiler this
extra step is unnecessary, but harmless.
.P
The cautious programmer should write code that does not depend on
the compiler version being used.  We therefore suggest the following
guideline for determining the SELECT return type:
.P
A SELECT operation with a 16-bit right operand returns a 16-bit
value.  The return type of a SELECT operation with a 32-bit right
operand is undefined, but is guaranteed to be an acceptable input
to a MINGLE operation so long as 16 or fewer bits are actually
selected.  Correct code should not depend on whether the return
type is 16 or 32 bits.\}
.P
Perhaps a simpler way of understanding the operation of the select operator
would be to examine the logic diagram on the following page (Figure 1), which
performs the select operation upon two 8-bit values, A and B. The gates used
are Warmenhovian logic gates, which means the outputs have four possible
values: low, high, undefined (value of an uninitialized flip-flop), and
oscillating (output of a NOR gate with one input low and the other input
connected to the output). These values are represented symbolically
by '0', '1', '?', and '\*(es'.
Note in particular that, while NOT-0 is 1 and NOT-1
is 0 as in two-valued logic, NOT-? is ? and NOT-\*(es is \*(es. The functions 
of the various gates are listed in Table 1.

#
# Transcribed to PIC by Eric S. Raymond from the paper original.
# The transcription to topologically correct but not geometrically perfect.
#
# I discovered late in the process that the gate spacing to gate width
# ratio should be 6/5, not 5/5. The only place the difference shows is
# in the zigzag part of the adventitious lead below gate 37, which is
# a bit narrower in this version than in the paper original.
#
# Minor liberties have been taken with the sizes of some features at the 
# left and right sides to fit the diagram on a letter-sized page.  The
# A/B input leads should really be a whole boxwidth wide, and the bus line
# rectangle was slightly wider and further right in the paper original.
# Also, there are only 15 "New York" terminals rather than 16, and in the
# original the bus terminal label texts were rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
#
# The whole diagram can be scaled horizontally or vertically by changing
# the boxwid and boxht variables.  At default scale the values boxwid =
# 0.60 boxht = 0.525 reproduce the paper version most exactly; they get
# the gate grid and leads nearly perfect.

.H 3 "Unary Operators"
.P
The unary operators are & (logical \fBAND\fR), V (logical \fBOR\fR),
and \*(vb (logical
\fBXOR\fR). This last character is obtained by overpunching a worm (\-) on a V
(V).
.if '\*c'y' \{\
(In C-INTERCAL'S ASCII environment, EBCDIC \*(vb is replaced by the
what (?). The compiler recognizes -<backspace>V as a valid
equivalent, in case you are concerned about compatibility with the 
Princeton compiler.) \}
The operator is inserted between the spot, two-spot, mesh, or
what-have-you, and the integer, thus: .&123, #\*(vb123. Multiple unary
operators may not be concatenated, thus the form #\*(vb&123 is invalid. This
will be covered later when precedence is discussed. These operators perform
their respective logical operations on all pairs of adjacent bits, the
result from the first and last bits going into the first bit of the result.
The effect is that of rotating the operand one place to the right and
ANDing, ORing, or XORing with its initial value. Thus, #&77 (binary =
1001101) is binary 0000000000000100 = 4, #V77 is binary 1000000001101111 =
32879, and #\*(vb77 is binary 1000000001101011 = 32875.
.H 3 "Precedence"
.SETR precedence
.P
Precedence of operators is as follows:
.sp 10
(The remainder of this page intentionally left blank)\*F
.FS
Keep in mind that the aim in designing INTERCAL was to have no 
precedents.
.FE
.bp
.P
This precedence (or lack thereof) may be overruled by grouping expressions
between pairs of sparks (') or rabbit-ears ("). Thus '#165\*(ct#203'~#358 
(binary value '10100101\*(ct11001011'~101100110) has the value 15, but
#165\*(ct'#203~#358' has the value 34915, and #165\*(ct#203~#358 is invalid
syntax and is completely valueless (except perhaps as an educational tool
to the programmer). A unary operator is applied to a sparked or rabbit-eared
expression by inserting the operator immediately following the opening spark
or ears. Thus, the invalid expression #\*(vb&123,
which was described earlier,
could be coded as '\*(vb#&123' or '\*(vb"&#123"'.
Note: In the interests of 
simplifying the sometimes overly-complex form of expressions, INTERCAL allows
a spark-spot combination ('.) to be replaced with a wow (!). Thus '.1~.2'
is equivalent to !1~.2', and 'V.1\*(ct.2' is equivalent to "V!1\*(ct.2'".
.P
Combining a rabbit-ears with a spot to form a rabbit (\o'".') is not permitted,
although the programmer is free to use it should he find an EBCDIC reader
which will properly translate a 12-3-7-8 punch.
.P
Sparks and/or rabbit-ears must also be used to distinguish among such
otherwise ambiguous subscripted and multiply-subscripted expressions as:
.DS L
        ,1 SUB #1 ~ #2
        ,1 SUB ,2 SUB #1 #2 #3
        ,1 SUB " ,2 SUB " ,3 SUB #1 " #2 " " #3 "
.DE
The third case may be isolated into either of its possible interpretations
by simply changing some pairs of rabbit-ears to sparks, instead of adding
more ears (which would only confuse the issue further). Ambiguous cases are
defined as those for which the compiler being used finds a legitimate
interpretation which is different from that which the user had in mind. See
also section 
.GETHN princeton
\&.
.H 1 "STATEMENTS"
.P
In this section is described the format of INTERCAL statements.
.H 2 "General Format"
.P
Statements may be entered in 'free format'. That is, more than one statement
may occur on a single card, and a statement may begin on one card and end
on a later one. Note that if this is done, all intervening cards and portions
thereof must be part of the same statement. That this restriction is necessary
is immediately apparent from the following example of what might occur if
statements could be interlaced.
.DS L
        DO .1 <- ".1\*(ct'&:51~"#\*(vb1c!12~;&75SUB"\*(vb'V.1~
        DO .2 <- '"!1\*(ct"&';\*(vb79SUB",&7SUB:173"'~!\*(vb9\*(ct
        .2'\*(ct,&1SUB:5~#33578"'"'"~'#65535\*(ct"\*(vb'V#&85'"'
        #8196'"'~.1"\*(ct.2'~'#&5\*(ct"'#1279\*(ct#4351'~#65535"'
.DE
The above statements are obviously meaningless. (For that matter, so are
the statements
.DS L
        DO .1 <- ".1\*(ct"&:51~"#\*(vb1\*(ct!12~;&75SUB"\*(vb'V.1~
        .2'\*(ct,&1SUB:5~#333578"'"'"~#65535\*(ct"\*(vb'V#&85'"'
        DO .2 <- '"!1\*(ct"&';\*(vb79SUB",&7SUB:173"'~!\*(vb9\*(ct
        #8196'"'~.1"\*(ct.2'~'#&5\*(ct"'#1279\*(ct#4351'~#65535"'
.DE
but this is not of interest here.)
.P
Spaces may be used freely to enhance program legibility (or at least reduce
program illegibility), with the restriction that no word of a statement
identifier (see section
.GETHN identifiers
) may contain any spaces.
.H 2 "Labels"
.P
A statement may begin with a
.B "logical line label"
enclosed in wax-wane pairs
(()). A statement may not have more than one label, although it is possible
to omit the label entirely. A line label is any integer from 1 to 65535,
which must be unique within each program. The user is cautioned, however,
that many line labels between 1000 and 1999 are used in the INTERCAL System
Library functions.
.H 2 "Identifiers and Qualifiers"
.SETR identifiers
.P
After the line label (if any), must follow one of the following statement
identifiers: DO, PLEASE, or PLEASE DO. These may be used interchangeably to
improve the aesthetics of the program. The identifier is then followed by
either, neither, or both of the following optional parameters (qualifiers):
(1) either of the character strings NOT or N'T, which causes the statement
to be automatically abstained from (see section
.GETHN abstain
) when execution
begins, and (2) a number between 0 and 100, preceded by a double-oh-seven
(%), which causes the statement to have only the specified percent chance
of being executed each time it is encountered in the course of execution.
.H 2 "Statements"
.P
Following the qualifiers (or, if none are used, the identifier) must occur
one of the 13 valid operations. (Exception: see section 
.GETHN comments
\&.) These are 
described individually in sections 
.GETHN calculate
 through 
.GETHN last_statement
\&.
.H 3 "Calculate"
.SETR calculate
.P
The INTERCAL equivalent of the half-mesh (=) in FORTRAN, BASIC, PL/I, and
others, is represented by an angle (<) followed by a worm (-). This
combination is read 'gets'. 32-bit variables may be assigned 16-bit values,
which are padded on the left with 16 zero bits. 16-bit variables may be
assigned 32-bit values only if the value is less than 65535. Thus, to
invert the least significant bit of the first element of 16-bit
2-dimensional array number 1, one could write:
.DS
,1SUB#1#1 <- '\*(vb,1SUB#1#1\*(ct#1'~'#0\*(ct#65535'
.DE
Similarly to SNOBOL and SPITBOL, INTERCAL uses the angle-worm to define the
dimensions of arrays. An example will probably best describe the format. 
To define 32-bit array number 7 as 3-dimensional, the first dimension being
seven, the second being the current value of 16-bit variable number seven,
and the third being the current value of the seventh element of 16-bit array
number seven (which is one-dimensional) mingled with the last three bits of
32-bit variable number seven, one would write (just before they came to take
him away):
.DS 
;7 <- #7 BY .7 BY ",7SUB#7"\*(ct':7~#7'
.DE
This is, of course, different from the statement:
.DS
;7 <- #7 BY .7 BY ,7SUB"#7\*(ct':7~#7'"
.DE
INTERCAL also permits the redefining of array dimensioning, which is done 
the same way as is the initial dimensioning. All values of items in an array
are lost upon redimensioning, unless they have been STASHed (see section
.GETHN stash
), in which case restoring them also restores the old dimensions.
.H 3 "NEXT"
.SETR next
.P
The NEXT statement is used both for subroutine calls and for unconditional
transfers. This statement takes the form:
.DS
DO (label) NEXT
.DE
(or, of course,
.DS
PLEASE DO (label) NEXT
.DE
etc.), where (label) represents any logical line label which appears in the
program. The effect of such a statement is to transfer control to the
statement specified, and to store in a push down list (which is initially
empty) the location from which the transfer takes place. Items may be
removed from this list and may be discarded or used to return to the
statement immediately following the NEXT statement. These operations are
described in sections 
.GETHN forget
 and
.GETHN resume
 respectively. The programmer is
generally advised to discard any stack entries which he does not intend to
utilize, since the stack has a maximum depth of 79 entries. A program's
attempting to initiate an 80th level of NEXTing will result in the fatal
error message, "PROGRAM HAS DISAPPEARED INTO THE BLACK LAGOON."
.H 3 "FORGET"
.SETR forget
.P
The statement PLEASE FORGET exp, where exp represents any expression
(except colloquial and facial expressions), causes the expression to be
evaluated, and the specified number of entries to be removed from the
NEXTing stack and discarded. An attempt to FORGET more levels of NEXTing
than are currently stacked will cause the stack to be emptied, and no error
condition is indicated. This is because the condition is not considered to
be an error. As described in section
.GETHN next
\&, it is good programming practice
to execute a DO FORGET #1 after using a NEXT statement as an unconditional
transfer, so that the stack does not get cluttered up with unused entries:
.DS L
.cs R 24
        DO (123) NEXT
        .
        .
  (123) DO FORGET #1
.cs R
.DE
.H 3 "RESUME"
.SETR resume
.P
The statement PLEASE RESUME exp has the same effect as FORGET, except that
program control is returned to the statement immediately following the NEXT
statement which stored in the stack the last entry to be removed. Note that
a rough equivalent of the FORTRAN computed GO TO and BASIC ON exp GO TO is
performed by a sequence of the form:
.DS L
.cs R 24
        DO (1) NEXT
        .
        .
    (1) DO (2) NEXT
        PLEASE FORGET #1
        .
        .
    (2) DO RESUME .1
.cs R
.DE
Unlike the FORGET statement, an attempt to RESUME more levels of NEXTing than
been stacked will cause program termination. See also section 
.GETHN give_up
\&.
.H 3 "STASH"
.SETR stash
.P
Since subroutines are not explicitly implemented in INTERCAL, the NEXT and
RESUME statements must be used to execute common routines. However, as
these routines might use the same variables as the main program, it is
necessary for them to save the values of any variables whose values they
alter, and later restore them. This process is simplified by the STASH
statement, which has the form DO STASH list, where list represents a
string of one or more variable or array names, separated by intersections
(+). Thus
.DS
PLEASE STASH .123+:123+,123
.DE
stashes the values of two variables and one entire array. The values are
left intact, and copies thereof are saved for later retrieval by (what else?)
the RETRIEVE statement (see section 
.GETHN retrieve
). It is not possible to STASH
single array items.
.H 3 "RETRIEVE"
.SETR retrieve
.P
PLEASE RETRIEVE list restores the previously STASHed values of the variables
and arrays named in the list. If a value has been stashed more than once,
the most recently STASHed values are RETRIEVEd, and a second RETRIEVE will
restore the second most recent values STASHed. Attempting to RETRIEVE a
value which has not been STASHed will result in the error message, "THROW
STICK BEFORE RETRIEVING."
.H 3 "IGNORE"
.SETR ignore
.P
The statement DO IGNORE list causes all subsequent statements to have no 
effect upon variables and/or arrays named in the list. Thus, for example, 
after the sequence
.DS L
        DO .1 <- #1
        PLEASE IGNORE .1
        DO .1 <- #0
.DE
16-bit variable number 1 would have the value 1, not 0. Inputting (see
section 
.GETHN input
) into an IGNOREd variable also has no effect. The condition
is annulled via the REMEMBER statement (see section
.GETHN remember
). Note that, when
a variable is being IGNOREd, its value, though immutable, is still
available for use in expressions and the like.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.P
Though the INTERCAL-72 manual laid down that the value of an IGNOREd
variable cannot change, it was unclear about whether or not a
statement which appears to change an IGNOREd variable is executed or
not.  This may appear to be a "If a tree falls in the forest..." type
of question, but if the statement in question has other side effects
it is not.
.P
Since another mechanism already exists for ABSTAINing from a
statement, C-INTERCAL's IGNORE only prevents the changing of the
specific variable in question, not the execution of the entire
statement.  In the present version of the language this only makes
a difference for the WRITE IN statement.  Attempting to WRITE IN
to an IGNOREd variable will cause a number to be read from the input,
which will be discarded since it cannot be stored in the variable. \}
.H 3 "REMEMBER"
.SETR remember
.P
PLEASE REMEMBER list terminates the effect of the IGNORE statement for all
variables and/or arrays named in the list. It does not matter if a variable
has been IGNOREd more than once, nor is it an error if the variable has not
been IGNOREd at all.
.H 3 "ABSTAIN"
.SETR abstain
.P
INTERCAL contains no simple equivalent to an IF statement or computed GO
TO, making it difficult to combine similar sections of code into a single
routine which occasionally skips around certain statements. The IGNORE
statement (see section 
.GETHN ignore
) is helpful in some cases, but a more viable
method is often required. In keeping with the goal of INTERCAL having
nothing in common with any other language, this is made possible via the
ABSTAIN statement.
.P
This statement takes on one of two forms. It may not take on both at any one
time. DO ABSTAIN FROM (label) causes the statement whose logical line label
is (label) to be abstained from. PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM gerund list causes all
statements of the specified type(s) to be abstained from, as in
.DS L
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM STASHING
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM IGNORING + FORGETTING
        PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM NEXTING
     or PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM CALCULATING
.DE
Statements may also be automatically abstained from at the start of
execution via the NOT or N'T parameter (see section 
.GETHN identifiers
).
.P
If, in the course of execution, a statement is encountered which is being
abstained from, it is ignored and control passes to the next statement in
the program (unless it, too, is being abstained from).
.P
The statement DO ABSTAIN FROM ABSTAINING is perfectly valid, as is DO ABSTAIN
FROM REINSTATING (although this latter is not usually recommended). However,
the statement DO ABSTAIN FROM GIVING UP is not accepted, even though DON'T
GIVE UP is.
.H 3 "REINSTATE"
.SETR reinstate
.P
The REINSTATE statement, like the ABSTAIN, takes as an argument either a 
line label or a gerund list. No other form of argument is permitted. For
example, the following is an invalid argument:
.DS L
        Given: x\(!=0, y\(!=0,  Prove: x+y=0
        Since x\(!=0, then x+1\(!=1, x+a\(!=a, x+y\(!=y.
        But what is y? y is anything but 0.
        Thus x+y \(!= anything but 0.
        Since x+y cannot equal anything but 0, x+y=0.
                                                         Q.E.D.
.DE
REINSTATEment nullifies the effects of an abstention. Either form of
REINSTATEment can be used to "free" a statement, regardless of whether the
statement was abstained from by gerund list, line label, or NOT. Thus,
PLEASE REINSTATE REINSTATING is not necessarily an irrelevant statement,
since it might free a DON'T REINSTATE command or a REINSTATE the line label
of which was abstained from. However, DO REINSTATE GIVING UP is invalid,
and attempting to REINSTATE a GIVE UP statement by line label will have no
effect. Note that this insures that DON'T GIVE UP will always be a
"do-nothing" statement.
.H 3 "GIVE UP"
.SETR give_up
.P
PLEASE GIVE UP is used to exit from a program. It has the effect of a PLEASE
RESUME #80. DON'T GIVE UP, as noted in section 
.GETHN reinstate
\&, is effectively a null
statement.
.H 3 "Input"
.SETR input
.P
Input is accomplished with the statement DO WRITE IN list, where list
represents a string of variables and/or elements or arrays, separated by
intersections. Numbers are represented on cards, each number on a separate
card, by spelling out each digit (in English) and separating the digits
with one or more spaces. A zero (0) may be spelled as either ZERO or OH.
Thus the range of (32-bit) input values permissible extends from ZERO (or
OH) through FOUR TWO NINE FOUR NINE SIX SEVEN TWO NINE FIVE.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
(For the convenience of aviators, C-INTERCAL accepts the spelling
NINER for NINE.  In the service of internationalization, C-INTERCAL
also accepts input digits in Sanskrit, Basque, Tagalog, Classical
Nahuatl, Georgian, Kwakiutl, and Volapuk. \}
.P
Attempting to write in a value greater than or equal to SIX FIVE FIVE THREE
SIX for a 16-bit variable will result in the error message, "DON'T BYTE OFF
MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW."
.H 3 "Output"
.P
Values may be output to the printer, one value per line, via the statement
DO READ OUT list, where the list contains variables, array elements, and/or
constants.  Output is in the form of "extended" Roman numerals (also called
"butchered" Roman numerals), with an overline
.if t (\(rn)
indicating the value below
is "times 1000", and lower-case letters indicating "times 1000000". Zero
is indicated by an overline with no character underneath. Thus, the range 
of (32-bit) output values possible is from 
.if t \(rn
.if n \{\
.nf
_
 
.fi \}
through
.ie t \o"i\(rn"\o"v\(rn"ccxciv\o"C\(rn"\o"M\(rn"\o"L\(rn"\o"X\(rn"\o"V\(rn"\o"I\(rn"\o"I\(rn"CCXCV.

Note: For values whose residues modulo 1000000 are less than 4000, M is

.H 3 "COME FROM"
.P
In which we try to precisely define a statement that should never
have been born, but is nevertheless one of the more useful statements
in INTERCAL.
.H 4 "Background"
.P
The earliest known description of the COME FROM statement in the computing
literature is in [R. L. Clark, "A linguistic contribution to GOTO-less
programming," Commun. ACM 27 (1984), pp. 349--350], part of the famous April
Fools issue of CACM.  The subsequent rush by language designers to include the
statement in their languages was underwhelming, one might even say nonexistent.
It was therefore decided that COME FROM would be an appropriate addition
to C-INTERCAL.
.H 4 "Description"
.P
There are two useful ways to visualize the action of the COME FROM
statement.  The simpler is to see that it acts like a GOTO when the
program is traced backwards in time.  More precisely, the statements
.DS L
(1)     DO <any statement>
        .
        .
        .
(2)     DO COME FROM (1)
.DE
should be thought of as being equivalent to
.DS L
(1)     DO <any statement>
(2)     DO GOTO (3)
        .
        .
        .
(3)     DO NOTHING
.DE
if INTERCAL actually had a GOTO statement at all, which of course it
doesn't.
.P
What this boils down to is that the statement DO COME FROM (label),
anywhere in the program, places a kind of invisible trap door
immediately after statement (label).  Execution or abstention of that
statement is immediately followed by an unconditional jump to the
COME FROM, unless the (label)ed statement is an executed NEXT, in which
case the jump occurs if the program attempts to RESUME back to that
NEXT statement.  It is an error for more than one COME FROM to refer
to the same (label).
.P
Modification of the target statement by ABSTAIN or by the % qualifier
affects only that statement, not the subsequent jump.  Such
modifications to the COME FROM itself, however, do affect the jump.
Encountering the COME FROM statement itself, rather than its target,
has no effect. \}
.SETR last_statement
.H 2 "Comments"
.SETR comments
.P
Unrecognizable statements, as noted in section 
.GETHN error_messages
\&, are flagged with a splat
(*) during compilation, and are not considered fatal errors unless they
are encountered during execution, at which time the statement (as input at 
compilation time) is printed and execution is terminated. This allows for 
an interesting (and, by necessity, unique) means of including comments in 
an INTERCAL listing. For example, the statement:
.sp 1
*       PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LINE HAS NO EFFECT
.P
will be ignored during execution due to the inclusion of the NOT qualifier.
User-supplied error messages are also easy to implement:
.sp 1
*       DO SOMETHING ABOUT OVERFLOW IN ;3
.P
as are certain simple conditional errors:
.DS L
.cs R 24
* (123) DON'T YOU REALIZE THIS STATEMENT SHOULD ONLY BE ENCOUNTERED
                ONCE?
        PLEASE REINSTATE (123)
.cs R
.DE
This pair of statements will cause an error exit the second time they are
encountered. Caution!! The appearance of a statement identifier in an
intended comment will be taken as the beginning of a new statement. Thus,
the first example on the preceding page could not have been:
.sp 1
*       PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LINE DOES NOTHING
.P
The third example, however, is valid, despite the appearance of two cases 
of D-space-O, since INTERCAL does not ignore extraneous spaces in statement
identifiers.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.H 1 "OUTSIDE COMMUNICATION"
.P
In which we try to remedy the fact that, due to I/O limitations, INTERCAL
can not even in principle perform the same tasks as other languages.  It
is hoped that this addition will permit INTERCAL users to waste vast
quantities of computer time well into the 21st century.
.H 2 "Motivation"
.P
One of the goals of INTERCAL was to provide a language which, though
different from all other languages, is nevertheless theoretically
capable of all the same tasks.  INTERCAL-72 failed to
accomplish this because its I/O functions could not handle arbitrary
streams of bits, or even arbitrary sequences of characters.  A
language which can't even send its input directly to its output
can hardly be considered as capable as other languages.
.H 2 "Turing Text Model"
.P
To remedy this problem, character I/O is now provided in a form based
on the "Turing Text" model, originally proposed by Jon Blow.  The
C-INTERCAL programmer can access this capability by placing a one-
dimensional array in the list of items given to a WRITE IN or READ OUT
statement.  On execution of the statement, the elements of the array
will, from first to last, be either loaded from the input or sent
to the output, as appropriate, in the manner described below.  There
is currently no support for I/O involving higher-dimensional arrays,
but some form of graphics might be a possible 2-D interpretation.
.P
The heart of the Turing Text model is the idea of a continuous loop
of tape containing, in order, all the characters in the machine's
character set.  When a character is received by the input routine,
the tape is advanced the appropriate number of spaces to bring
that character under the tape head, and the number of spaces the
tape was moved is the number that is actually seen by the INTERCAL
program.  Another way to say this is that the number placed in an
INTERCAL array is the difference between the character just
received and the previous character, modulo the number of characters
in the machine character set.
.P
Output works in just the opposite fashion, except that the characters
being output come from the other side of the tape.  From this position
the characters on the tape appear to be in reverse order, and are
individually backwards as well.  (We would show you what it looks
like, but we don't have a font with backwards letters available.
Use your imagination.)  The effect is that a number is taken out
of an INTERCAL array, subtracted from the last character output---
i.e., the result of the last subtraction---and then sent on down
the output channel.  The only catch is that the character as seen
by the INTERCAL program is the mirror-image of the character as
seen by the machine and the user.  The bits of the character are
therefore taken in reverse order as it is sent to the output.
Note that this bit reversal affects only the character seen by
the outside world; it does not affect the character stored internally
by the program, from which the next output number will be subtracted.
All subtractions are done modulo the number of characters in the
character set.
.P
Two different tapes are used for input and for output to allow for
future expansion of the language to include multiple input and
output channels.  Both tapes start at character 0 when a program
begins execution.  On input, when an end of file marker is reached
the number placed in the array is one greater than the highest-
numbered character on the tape.
.H 2 "Example Program"
.P
If all this seems terribly complicated, it should be made perfectly
clear by the following example program, which simply maps its input
to its output (like a simplified UNIX "cat").  It assumes that
characters are 8 bits long, but that's fine since the current version
of C-INTERCAL does too.  It uses the standard library routines for addition
and subtraction.
.DS L
        DO ,1 <- #1
        DO .4 <- #0
        DO .5 <- #0
        DO COME FROM (30)
        DO WRITE IN ,1
        DO .1 <- ,1SUB#1
        DO (10) NEXT
        PLEASE GIVE UP
(20)    PLEASE RESUME '?.1$#256'~'#256$#256'
(10)    DO (20) NEXT
        DO FORGET #1
        DO .2 <- .4
        DO (1000) NEXT
        DO .4 <- .3~#255
        DO .3 <- !3~#15'$!3~#240'
        DO .3 <- !3~#15'$!3~#240'
        DO .2 <- !3~#15'$!3~#240'
        DO .1 <- .5
        DO (1010) NEXT
        DO .5 <- .2
        DO ,1SUB#1 <- .3
(30)    PLEASE READ OUT ,1
.DE
For each number received in the input array, the program first tests
the #256 bit to see if the end of file has been reached.  If not, the
previous input character is subtracted off to obtain the current
input character.  Then the order of the bits is reversed to find
out what character should be sent to the output, and the result
is subtracted from the last character sent.  Finally, the difference
is placed in an array and given to a READ OUT statement.  See?
We told you it was simple! \}

.H 1 "TriINTERCAL"
.P
In which it is revealed that bitwise operations are too ordinary for
hard-core INTERCAL programmers, and extensions to other bases are
discussed.  These are not, strictly speaking, extensions to INTERCAL
itself, but rather new dialects sharing most of the features of the
parent language.
.H 2 "Motivation"
.P
INTERCAL is really a pretty sissy language.  It tries hard to be
different, but when you get right down to its roots, what do you find?
You find bits, that's what.  Plain old ones and zeroes, in groups of
16 and 32, just like every other language you've ever heard of.  And
what operations can you perform on these bits?  The INTERCAL operators
may arrange and permute them in weird and wonderful ways, but at the
bit level the operators are the same AND, OR and XOR you've seen
countless times before.
.P
Once the prospective INTERCAL programmer masters the unusual syntax,
she finds herself working with the familiar Boolean operators on
perfectly ordinary unsigned integer words.  Even the constants she uses
are familiar.  After all, who would not immediately recognize #65535
and #32768?  It may take a just a moment more to figure out #65280,
and #21845 and #43690 could be puzzles until she notices that they
sum to #65535, but basically she's still on her home turf.  The 16-bit
limit on constants actually works in the programmer's favor by insuring
that very long anonymous constants can not appear in INTERCAL programs.
And this is in a language that is supposed to be different from any
other!
.H 2 "Abandon All Hope..."
.P
Standard INTERCAL is based on variables consisting of ordinary bits
and familiar Boolean operations on those bits.  In pursuit of uniqueness,
it seems appropriate to provide a new dialect, otherwise identical to
INTERCAL, which instead uses variables consisting of trits, i.e. ternary
digits, and operators based on tritwise logical operations.  This is
intended to be a separate dialect, rather than an extension to INTERCAL
itself, for a number of reasons.  Doing it this way avoids word-length
conflicts, does not spoil the elegance of the Spartan INTERCAL operator
set, and dodges the objections of those who might feel it too great an
alteration to the original language.  Primarily, though, giving INTERCAL
programmers the ability to switch numeric base at will amounts to
excessive functionality.  So much better that a programmer choose a base
at the outset and then be forced to stick with it for the remainder of
the program.
.H 2 "Compiler Operation"
.P
The same compiler, ick, supports both INTERCAL and TriINTERCAL.
This has the advantage that future bug fixes and additions to the
language not related to arithmetic immediately apply to both versions.
The compiler recognizes INTERCAL source files by the extension '.i',
and TriINTERCAL source files by the extension '.3i'.  It's as simple
as that.  There is no way to mix INTERCAL and TriINTERCAL source in
the same program, and it is not always possible to determine which
dialect a program is written in just by looking at the source code.
.H 2 "Data Types"
.P
The two TriINTERCAL data types are 10-trit unsigned integers and
20-trit unsigned integers.  All INTERCAL syntax for distinguishing
data types is ported to these new types in the obvious way.  Small
words may contain numbers from #0 to #59048, large words may contain
numbers from #0$#0 to #59048$#59048.  Errors are signaled for constants
greater than #59048 and for attempts to WRITE IN numbers too large
for a given variable or array element to hold.
.P
Note that though TriINTERCAL considers all numbers to be unsigned,
nothing prevents the programmer from implementing arithmetic operations
that treat their operands as signed.  Three's complement is one obvious
choice, but balanced ternary notation is also a possibility.  This
latter is a very pretty and symmetrical system in which all 2 trits
are treated as if they had the value -1.
.H 2 "Operators"
.P
The TriINTERCAL operators are designed to inherit the relevant properties
of the standard INTERCAL operators, so that both can be considered as
merely different aspects of the same Platonic ideal.  (Not that the word
"ideal" is ever particularly relevant when used in connection with
INTERCAL.)
.H 3 "Binary Operators I"
.P
The binary operators carry over from the original language with only
minor changes.  The MINGLE operator ($) creates a 20-trit word by
alternating trits from its two 10-trit operands.  The SELECT operator (~)
is a little more complicated, since the ternary tritmask may contain 0, 1,
and 2 trits.  If we observe that the SELECT operation on binary operands
amounts to a bitwise AND and some rearrangement of bits, it seems
appropriate to base the SELECT for ternary operands on a tritwise AND in
the analogous fashion.  We therefore postpone the definition of SELECT
until we know what a tritwise AND looks like.
.H 3 "Unary Operators"
.P
The unary operators in INTERCAL are all derived from the familiar
Boolean operations on single bits.  To extend these operations to trits,
we first ask ourselves what the important properties of these operations
are that we wish to be preserved, then design the tritwise operators so
that they behave in a similar fashion.
.H 4 "Unary Logical Operators"
.P
Let's start with AND and OR.  To begin with, these can be considered
"choice" or "preference" operators, as they always return one of their
operands.  AND can be described as wanting to return 0, but returning 1
if it is given no other choice, i.e., if both operands are 1.  Similarly,
OR wants to return 1 but returns 0 if that is its only choice.  From
this it is immediately apparent that each operator has an identity
element that "always loses", and a dominator element that "always wins".
.P
AND and OR are commutative and associative, and each distributes
over the other.  They are also symmetric with each other, in the sense
that AND looks like OR and OR looks like AND when the roles of 0 and 1
are interchanged (De Morgan's Laws).  This symmetry property seems to be
a key element to the idea that these are logical, rather than arithmetic,
operators.  In a three-valued logic we would similarly expect a three-
way symmetry among the three values 0, 1 and 2 and the three operators
AND, OR and (of course) BUT.
.P
The following tritwise operations have all the desired properties:
OR returns the greater of its two operands.  That is, it returns 2 if
it can get it, else it tries to return 1, and it returns 0 only if both
operands are 0.  AND wants to return 0, will return 2 if it can't get
0, and returns 1 only if forced.  BUT wants 1, will take 0, and tries
to avoid 2.  The equivalents to De Morgan's Laws apply to rotations
of the three elements, e.g., 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 0.  Each operator
distributes over exactly one other operator, so the property
"X distributes over Y" is not transitive.  The question of which way
this distributivity ring goes around is left as an exercise for the
student.
.P
In TriINTERCAL programs the whirlpool (@) symbol denotes the unary
tritwise BUT operation.  You can think of the whirlpool as drawing
values preferentially towards the central value 1.  Alternatively,
you can think of it as drawing your soul and your sanity inexorably
down...
.P
On the other hand, maybe it's best you \fInot\fR think of it that way.
.P
A few comments about how these operators can be used.  OR acts like
a tritwise maximum operation.  AND can be used with tritmasks.  0's
in a mask wipe out the corresponding elements in the other operand,
while 1's let the corresponding elements pass through unchanged.  2's
in a mask consolidate the values of nonzero elements, as both 1's and
2's in the other operand yield 2's in the output.  BUT can be used to
create "partial tritmasks".  0's in a mask let BUT eliminate 2's from
the other operand while leaving other values unchanged.  Of course,
the symmetry property guarantees that the operators don't really
behave differently from each other in any fundamental way; the apparent
differences come from the intuitive view that a 0 trit is "not set"
while a 1 or 2 trit is "set".
.H 4 "Binary Operators II"
.P
At this point we can define SELECT, since we now know what the
tritwise AND looks like.  SELECT takes the binary tritwise AND of
its two operands.  It shifts all the trits of the result corresponding
to 2's in the right operand over to the right (low) end of the result,
then follows them with all the output trits corresponding to 1's in
the right operand.  Trits corresponding to 0's in the right operand,
which are all 0 anyway, occupy the remaining space at the left end of
the output word.  Both 10-trit and 20-trit operands are accepted,
and are padded with zeroes on the left if necessary.  The output
type is determined the same way as in standard INTERCAL.
.H 4 "Unary Arithmetic Operators"
.P
Now that we've got all that settled, what about XOR?  This is
easily the most-useful of the three unary INTERCAL operators,
because it combines in one package the operations ADD WITHOUT CARRY,
SUBTRACT WITHOUT BORROW, BITWISE NOT-EQUAL, and BITWISE NOT.  In
TriINTERCAL we can't have all of these in the same operator, since
addition and subtraction are no longer the same thing.  The solution
is to split the XOR concept into two operators.  The ADD WITHOUT CARRY
operation is represented by the new sharkfin (^) symbol, while the
old what (?) symbol represents SUBTRACT WITHOUT BORROW.  The reason for
this choice is so that what (?) will also represent the TRITWISE NOT-EQUAL
operation.
.P
Note that what (?), unlike the other four unary operators, is not
symmetrical.  It should be thought of as rotating its operand one trit
to the right (with wraparound) and then subtracting off the trits of
the original number.  These subtractions are done without borrowing,
i.e., trit-by-trit modulo 3.
.H 3 "Examples"
.P
The TriINTERCAL operators really aren't all that bad once you get
used to them.  Let's look at a few examples to show how they can
be used in practice.  In all of these examples the input value is
contained in the 10-trit variable .3.
.P
In INTERCAL, single-bit values often have to be converted from
{0,1} to {1,2} for use in RESUME statements.  Examples of how to do
this appear in the original manual.  In TriINTERCAL the expression
"^.3$#1"~#1 sends 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 2.  If the 1-trit input value can
take on any of its three possible states, however, we will also have
to deal with the 2 case.  The expression "V.3$#1"~#1 sends {0,1} -> 1
and 2 -> 2.  To test if a trit is set, we can use "V'"&.3$#2"~#1'$#1"~#1,
sending 0 -> 1 and {1,2} -> 2.  To reverse the test we use
"?'"&.3$#2"~#1'$#1"~#1, sending 0 -> 2 and {1,2} -> 1.  Note that we
have not been taking full advantage of the new SELECT operator.  These
last two expressions can be simplified into "V!3~#2'$#1"~#1 and
"?!3~#2'$#1"~#1, which perform exactly the same mappings.  Finally, if
we need a 3-way test, we can use "@'"^.3$#7"~#4'$#2"~#10, which
obviously sends 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, and 2 -> 3.
.P
For an unrelated example, the expression "^.3$.3"~"#0$#29524"
converts all of the 1-trits of .3 into 2's and all of the 2-trits
into 1's.  In balanced ternary, where 2-trits represent -1 values,
this is the negation operation.
.H 2 "Beyond Ternary..."
.P
While we're at it, we might as well extend this multiple bases
business a little farther.  The ick compiler actually recognizes
filename suffixes of the form '.Ni', where N is any number from 2
to 7.  2 of course gives standard INTERCAL, while 3 gives TriINTERCAL.
We cut off before 8 because octal notation is the smallest base used
to facilitate human-to-machine communication, and this seems quite
contrary to the basic principles behind INTERCAL.  The small data
types hold 16 bits, 10 trits, 8 quarts, 6 quints, 6 sexts, or 5 septs,
and the large types are always twice this size.
.P
As for operators, '?' is always SUBTRACT WITHOUT BORROW, and '^'
is always ADD WITHOUT CARRY.  'V' is the OR operation and always
returns the max of its inputs.  '&' is the AND operation, which chooses
0 if possible but otherwise returns the max of the inputs.  '@' is BUT,
which prefers 1, then 0, then the max of the remaining possibilities.
Rather than add more special symbols forever, a numeric modifier may
be placed directly before the '@' symbol to indicate the operation
that prefers one of the digits not already represented.  Thus in files
ending in '.5i', the permitted unary operators are '?', '^', '&', '@',
\&'2@', '3@', and 'V'.  Use of such barbarisms as '0@' to represent '&'
are not permitted, nor is the use of '@' or '^' in files with either
of the extensions '.i' or '.2i'.  Why not?  You just can't, that's why.
Don't ask so many questions.
.P
As a closing example, we note that in balanced quinary notation,
where 3 means -2 and 4 means -1, the negation operation can be written
as either
.DS L
  DO .1 <- "^'"^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"'$'"^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"'"~"#0$#3906"
.DE
or as
.DS L
  DO .1 <- "^.3$.3"~"#0$#3906"
  DO .1 <- "^.1$.1"~"#0$#3906"
.DE
These work because multiplication by -1 is the same as multiplication
by 4, modulo 5.
.P
Now go beat your head against the wall for a while.\}
.H 1 "SUBROUTINE LIBRARY"
.SETR sublib
.P
INTERCAL provides several built-in subroutines to which control can be
transferred to perform various operations. These operations include many
useful functions which are not easily representable in INTERCAL, such as
addition, subtraction, etc.
.H 2 "Usage"
.P
In general, the operands are .1, .2, etc., or :1, :2, etc., and the result(s)
are stored in what would have been the next operand(s). For instance, one
routine adds .1 to .2 and store the sum in .3, with .4 being used to indicate
overflow. All variables not used for results are left unchanged.
.H 2 "Available Functions"

.P
At the time of this writing, only the most fundamental operations are offered
in the library, as a more complete selection would require prohibitive time

.H 1 "PROGRAMMING HINTS"
.SETR proghints
.P
For the user looking to become more familiar with the INTERCAL language, we
present in this section an analysis of a complex program, as well as some
suggested projects for the ambitious programmer.
.P
Considering the effort involved in writing an INTERCAL program, it was 
decided in putting together this manual to use an already existing program 
for instructive analysis. Since there was only one such program available,
we have proceeded to use it. It is known as the "INTERCAL System Library."
.H 2 "Description"
.P
The program listing begins on the second page following. It is in the same
format as would be produced by the Princeton INTERCAL compiler in FORMAT
mode with WIDTH=62 (see section 
.GETHN princeton
). For a description of the functions
performed by the Library, see section 
.GETHN functions
\&.
.H 2 "Analysis"
.P
We shall not attempt to discuss here the algorithms used, but rather we
shall point out some of the general techniques applicable to a wide range
of problems.
.P
Statements 10, 14, 15, and 26 make up a virtual "computed GO TO". When
statement 10 is executed, control passes eventually to statement 16 or 11,
depending on whether .5 contains #1 or #2, respectively. The value of .5
is determined in statement 9, which demonstrates another handy technique.
To turn an expression, exp, with value #0 or #1, into #1 or #2 (for use in
a "GO TO"), use "\*(vb'exp'\*(ct#1"~#3.
To reverse the condition (i.e., convert #0
to #2 and leave #1 alone) use "\*(vb'exp'\*(ct#2"~#3.
.P
Certain conditions are easily checked. For example, to test for zero,
select the value from itself and select the bottom bit (see statement 54).
To test for all bits being 1's, select the value from itself and select the
top bit (see statement 261). The test for greater than, performed in
statements 192 and 193 on 32-bit values, employs binary logical operations,
which are performed as follows:
.DS
\&'\*(vb.1\*(ct.2'~'#0\*(ct#65535'
.DE
for 16-bit values or, for 32-bit values:
.DS L
        "'\*(vb":1~'#65535\*(ct30'"\*(ct":2~'#65535\*(ct#0'"'~'#0
        \*(ct#65535'"\*(ct"'\*(vb":1~'#0\*(ct#65535'"\*(ct":2~'#0
        \*(ct#65535'"'~'#0\*(ct#65535'"
.DE
(The proofs are left as an exercise to the reader.)
.P
Testing for greater-than with 16-bit values is somewhat simpler and is done
with the pair of statements:
.DS L
        DO .C <- '\*(vb.Ac.B'~'#0\*(ct#65535'
        DO .C <- '&"'.A~.C'~'"\*(vb'\*(vb.C~.C'\*(ct#32768"
                ~"#0\*(ct#65535"'"\*(ct".C~.C"'~#1
.DE
This sets .C (a dummy variable) to #1 if .A > .B, and #0 otherwise. The
expression may be expanded as described above to instead set .C to #1 or
#2.
.P
Note also in statement 220 the occurrence of ~"#65535\*(ct#65535". Although
these operations select the entire value, they are not extraneous, as they
ensure that the forthcoming \*(vbs will be operating on 32-bit values.
.P
In several virtual computed GO TOs the DO FORGET #1 (statement 15 in the
earlier example) has been omitted, since the next transfer of control would
be a DO RESUME #1.  By making this a DO RESUME #2 instead, the FORGET may
be forgotten.
.P
In statement 64, note that .2 is STASHed twice by a single statement. This
is perfectly legal.
.P
Lastly, note in statements 243 and 214 respectively, expressions for
shifting 16- and 32-bit variables logically one place to the left.
Statement 231 demonstrates right-shifting for 32-bit variables.

.H 2 "Programming Suggestions"
.P
For the novice INTERCAL programmer, we provide here a list of suggested 
INTERCAL programming projects:
.P
Write an integer exponentiation subroutine.  :1 <- .1 raised to the .2 power.
.P
Write a double-precision sorting subroutine. Given 32-bit array ;1 of size
:1, sort the contents into numerically increasing order, leaving the results
in ;1.
.P
Generate a table of prime numbers.
.P
Put together a floating-point library, using 32-bit variables to represent
floating-point numbers (let the upper half be the mantissa and the lower
half be the characteristic).  The library should be capable of performing 
floating-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well
as the natural logarithm function.
.P
Program a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  This project would probably entail
the writing of the floating-point library as well as sine and cosine functions.
.P
Calculate, to :1 places, the value of pi.
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.P
(The first three and last one of the preceding suggested projects from
the INTERCAL-72 manual are included in the C-INTERCAL distribution's 
pit directory of sample code.  The floating-point library and FFT
routine remain as worthy challenges...) \} 
.bp
.H 1 "ERROR MESSAGES"
.SETR error_messages
.P
Due to INTERCAL's implementation of comment lines (see section 4.5), most
error messages are produced during execution instead of during compilation.
All errors except those not causing immediate termination of program execution
are treated as fatal.
.H 2 "Format"
.P
All error messages appear in the following form:
.DS L
        ICLnnnI (error message)
                ON THE WAY TO STATEMENT nnnn
                CORRECT SOURCE AND RESUBMIT
.DE
The message varies depending upon the error involved.  For undecodable
statements the message is the statement itself.  The second line tells
which statement would have been executed next had the error not occurred.
Note that if the error is due to 80 attempted levels of NEXTing, the
statement which would have been executed next need not be anywhere near the
statement causing the error.
.H 2 "Messages"
.P
Brief descriptions of the different error types are listed below according
to message number.
.BL
.LI 000
An undecodable statement has been encountered in the course of
execution. Note that keypunching errors can be slightly disastrous,
since if 'FORGET' were misspelled F-O-R-G-E-R, the results would 
probably not be those desired. Extreme misspellings may have even 
more surprising consequences. For example, misspelling 'FORGET' 
R-E-S-U-M-E could have drastic results.
.LI 017
An expression contains a syntax error.
.LI 079
Improper use has been made of statement identifiers.
.LI 099
Improper use has been made of statement identifiers.
.LI 123
Program has attempted 80 levels of NEXTing.
.LI 129
Program has attempted to transfer to a non-existent line label.
.LI 139
An ABSTAIN or REINSTATE statement references a non-existent line label.
.LI 182
A line label has been multiply defined.
.LI 197
An invalid line label has been encountered.
.LI 200
An expression involves an unidentified variable.
.LI 240
An attempt has been made to give an array a dimension of zero.
.LI 241
Invalid dimensioning information was supplied in defining or using
an array.
.LI 275
A 32-bit value has been assigned to a 16-bit variable.
.LI 436
A retrieval has been attempted for an unSTASHed value.
.LI 533
A WRITE IN statement or interleave (\*(ct) operation has produced a
value requiring over 32 bits to represent.
.LI 562
Insufficient data.
.LI 579
Input data is invalid.
.LI 621
The expression of a RESUME statement evaluated to #0.
.LI 632
Program execution was terminated via a RESUME statement instead of
GIVE UP.
.LI 633
Execution has passed beyond the last statement of the program.
.LI 774
A compiler error has occurred (see section 
.GETHN princeton
).
.LI 778
.ie '\*c'n' \{\
An unexplainable compiler error has occurred (see J. Lyon or D. Woods)\}.
.el An unexplainable compiler error has occurred.
.LE
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.P
The following error codes are new in C-INTERCAL:

.if '\*c'y' \{\
.H 1 "The C-INTERCAL Compiler"
.H 2 "Character Set"
.P
The C-INTERCAL compiler uses ASCII rather than EBCDIC. We follow the
Atari implementation by (a) replacing the change sign (\*(ct) with
big money ($) as the mingle operator, and (b) replacing the
bookworm (\*(vb) symbol with what (?) as the exclusive-or
operator.
.H 2 "Usage and Compilation Options"
.P
To compile an INTERCAL program `foo.i' to executable code, just do

        ick foo.i

There's a -c option that leaves the generated C code in place for
inspection (suppressing compilation to machine code), a -d option that
enables verbose parse reporting from the yacc/bison parser, a -t
option that requires strict INTERCAL-72 compliance (rejecting COME
FROM and the extensions for bases other than two), a -b option that
disables the INTERCAL-72 random-bug feature (E774), and an -O option
that enables the (hah!) optimizer.  Invoking ick -?  prints a usage
message.
.P
Another compilation switch affects C-INTERCAL's runtime behavior.  The `-C'
option forces output in "clockface" mode, for superstitious users who
believe writing "IV" upside-down offends IVPITER and would rather
see IIII.
.H 2 "Runtime Options"
.P
Every C-INTERCAL runtime also accepts certain options at runtime. 
These include [+/-]help, [+/-]traditional, and [+/-]wimpmode. 
The help option (with either + or -) triggers a 'usage' message. The
+traditional option is presently a no-op.
.P
Steve explains: "The wimpmode option is the most interesting. I found
myself always running my test programs with filters on both ends to
work around the \&'nifty' INTERCAL number representations. This was so
painful that I decided it would be LESS painful (and a lot less code)
if I added a 'wimp' option.  With the +wimpmode option, the user is
subjected to a humiliating message about what a wimp he or she is to
use this mode, but after that is allowed to use conventional numerical
notation.  While such a mode doubtless violates to some extent the
INTERCAL philosophy, the fact that a 'unbutcher' command has been
posted clearly indicates the need for it. Anyway... if you don't like
it, don't use it... the default is -wimpmode (i.e. NOT wimp mode)."
.H 2 "PLEASE Politesse Checking"
.P
A feature of INTERCAL-72 not documented in the original manual was that it
required a certain level of politesse from the programmer.  If fewer than
1/5th of the program statements included the PLEASE qualifier, the program
would be rejected as insufficiently polite.  If more than 1/3rd of them
included PLEASE, the program would be rejected as excessively polite.
.P
This check has been implemented in C-INTERCAL.  To assist programmers in
coping with it, the intercal.el mode included with the distribution randomly
expands "do " in entered source to "DO PLEASE" or "PLEASE DO" 1/4th of the
time. \}
.if '\*c'y' \{\
.\" This is the same text as the ATARI NOTES at the end of the manual.
.H 1 "The Atari Implementation"
.P
The Atari implementation of INTERCAL differs from the original Princeton
version primarily in the use of ASCII rather than EBCDIC. Since there is no
"change" sign (\*(ct) in ASCII, we have substituted the "big money" ($) as the
mingle operator. We feel that this correctly represents the increasing cost
of software in relation to hardware. (Consider that in 1970 one could get
RUNOFF for free, to run on a $20K machine, whereas today a not quite as
powerful formatter costs $99 and runs on a $75 machine.)  We also feel that
there should be no defensible contention that INTERCAL has any sense.
Also, since overpunches are difficult to read on the average VDT, the
exclusive-or operator may be written ?.  This correctly expresses the
average person's reaction on first encountering exclusive-or, especially on
a PDP-11.  Note that in both of these cases, the over-punched symbol may
also be used if one is masochistic, or concerned with portability to the
Princeton compiler.  The correct over-punch for "change" is "c<backspace>/"
and the correct over-punch for \*(vb is "V<backspace>-".  These codes will be
properly printed if you have a proper printer, and the corresponding EBCDIC
code will be produced by the /IBM option on the LIST command. \}

.H 2 "The Princeton Compiler" \}
.el .H 1 "The Princeton Compiler"
.P
The Princeton compiler, written in SPITBOL (a variant of
SNOBOL), performs the compilation in two stages. First the
INTERCAL source is converted into SPITBOL source, then the
latter is compiled and executed.
.SETR princeton
.P
It should be noted that the Princeton compiler fails to
properly interpret certain multiply-subscripted expressions,
such as:
.DS
        ",1SUB",2SUB#1"#2"
.DE
.P
This is not a "bug". Being documented, it is merely a
"restriction". Such cases may be resolved by alternating
sparks and ears in various levels of expression nesting:
.DS
        ",1SUB',2SUB#1'#2"
.DE
which is advisable in any case, since INTERCAL expressions
are unreadable enough as is.
.P
Since there is currently no catalogued procedure for
invoking the compiler, the user must include the in-line
procedure shown on the following page in his job before the
compilation step. Copies of this in-line procedure may be
obtained at any keypunch if the proper keys are struck.
.P
The compiler is then executed in the usual manner:
.DS L

        // EXEC INTERCAL[,PARM='parameters']
        //COMPILE.SYSIN DD *
        {INTERCAL source deck}
        /* 
        //EXECUTE.SYSWRITE DD *
        {input data}
        /*

.DE
The various parameters are described following the in-line
procedure. At most one parameter from each set may apply to
a given compilation; if more than one are specified, the
results are undefined, and may vary depending upon the
particular set of options. The default parameters are
underlined.

In the default mode, the compiler will print a
list of all options in effect, including the
defaults for unspecified parameter groups and the
effective option for those sets where one was
specified. If NOOPT is requested, it causes the
default mode to be assumed.

.LI "\fBOPTSUB\fR
.LI "NOOPTSUB"
.LI "NOSUB"
.LI " "
Unless 'NOOPTSUB' is requested, the System Library
is optimized, resulting in much more rapid
NOSUB processing of function calls. Specifying NOOPTSUB
causes the non-optimized INTERCAL code shown in
section 6.3 to be used, whereas NOSUB requests
that the System Library be omitted altogether.

.LI IAMBIC
.LI "\fBPROSE\fR
.LI " "
The IAMBIC parameter permits the programmer to use
poetic license and thus write in verse. If the
reader does not believe it possible to write verse
in INTERCAL, he should send the authors a stamped,
self-addressed envelope, along with any INTERCAL
program, and they will provide one which is verse.

.LI "\fBFORMAT\fR"
.LI NOFORMAT
.LI " "
In FORMAT mode, each statement printed is put on a
separate line (or lines). In NOFORMAT mode, the
free-format source is printed exactly as input.
In this latter case, statement numbers are
provided only for the first statement on a card,
and they may be only approximate. Also,
unrecognizable statements are not flagged.

.LI SEQ
.LI "\fBNOSEQ\fR"
.LI " "
If the source deck has sequence numbers in columns
73 through 80, specifying 'SEQ' will cause them to
be ignored.

.LI "SOURCE"
.LI "\fBNOSOURCE\fR"
.LI " "
If NOSOURCE is selected, all source listing is
suppressed.

.LI LIST
.LI "\fBNOLIST\fR"
.LI " "
If LIST is specified, the compiler will provide a
list of statement numbers catalogued according to
type of statement. The compiler uses this table
to perform abstentions by gerund.

.LI "WIDTH=nn"
.LI " "
This sets the width (in number of characters) of
the output line for FORMAT mode output. The
default is
.B 132.

.LI "CODE"
.LI "\fBNOCODE\fR"
.LI " "
Include 'CODE' in the parameter list to obtain a
listing of the SPITBOL code produced for each
INTERCAL statement.

.LI "LINES=nn"
.LI " "
This determines the number of lines per page,
during both compilation and execution. The
default is
.B 60.

.LI DECK
.LI "\fBNODECK\fR"
.LI " "
Selecting 'DECK' will cause the compiler to punch
out a SPITBOL object deck which may then be run
without reinvoking the INTERCAL (or SPITBOL)
compiler.

.LI "\fBKIDDING\fR"
.LI NOKIDDING
.LI " "
Select NOKIDDING to eliminate the snide remarks
which ordinarily accompany INTERCAL error
messages.

.LI "\fBGO\fR"
.LI NOGO
.LI " "
Specifying 'NOGO' will cause  the program to be
compiled but not executed. EXECUTE/NOEXECUTE may
be substituted for GO/NOGO, but this will result
in an error, and GO will be assumed.

.LI "\fBBUG\fR"
.LI NOBUG
.LI " "
Under the default, there is a fixed probability of
a fatal compiler bug being worked at random into
the program being compiled. Encountering this bug
during execution results in error message 774 (see
section 7.2). This probability is reduced to zero
under 'NOBUG'. This does not affect the
probability (presumably negligible) of error
message 778.
