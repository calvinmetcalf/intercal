.SH NAME
ick \- INTERCAL compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ick
.I "[options] file"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR ick
command.
This manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program
did not have a manual page, and was then added back to the main
distribution.
Fuller documentation is available via the command
.B info ick
(for the
.B ick
command itself; even fuller documentation is available via
.B info C-INTERCAL
(which contains the documentation for both the compiler and the
INTERCAL language)).
.\"Comment this back in on Debian:
.\"There is also other documentation in
.\".B /usr/share/doc/intercal
.\"and
.\".B /usr/share/doc/intercal/examples
.\"as one would expect on a Debian system.
.PP
.B ick
takes INTERCAL programs and generates code from them (by running gcc).
.PP
Note that the base in which a program is written is deduced from its
extension; INTERCAL programs in base 2 must have the extension .i,
INTERCAL programs in bases from 3 to 7 must have an extension from .3i
to .7i respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Compile INTERCAL to C, but don't compile the resulting C.
.TP
.B \-d
Print yacc debugging information (implies -c).
.TP
.B \-t
Requires strict INTERCAL-72 compliance (rejecting COME FROM, the extensions
for bases other than two, and other features not found in INTERCAL-72).
.TP
.B \-b
Disables the INTERCAL-72 random-bug feature.
.TP
.B \-O
Attempt to optimize expressions in the generated code.
.TP
.B \-C
Clockface output (using IIII rather than IV in Roman numerals).
.TP
.B \-f
Optimize control flow in generated code (prevents -yp).
.TP
.B \-F
Optimize everything in generated code for
speed, regardless of how slow the compiler becomes or how
large the object file becomes. Implies -fO, prevents -cdghpyH.
.TP
.B \-h
Print optimizer debugging information (implies -cO).
.TP
.B \-H
Print verbose optimizer debugging information (implies -cO).
.TP
.B \-hH
Print optimizer debugging information in a different form (implies -cO).
.TP
.B \-y
Run the yuk debugger on the code (prevents -fm).
.TP
.B \-p
Run the yuk profiler on the code (prevents -fm).
.TP
.B \-m
Allow multithreading and backtracking (prevents -yp).
.TP
.B \-v
Allow anything on the left of an assignment, and turn off the
protection that constants otherwise have against being assigned to
(prevents -fFOP).
.TP
.B \-P
Compile PIC-INTERCAL rather than INTERCAL (prevents -mFvx, implies -cfO).
.TP
.B \-o
Output to stdout rather than .c (implies -c).
.TP
.B \-X
Interpret ambiguous syntax such as ? and @ with Princeton meanings (as
used by CLC-INTERCAL), rather than with the default Atari meanings.
.TP
.B \-x
Use CLC-INTERCAL rules for text I/O and for abstaining from a GIVE UP
by label (prevents -P).
.TP
.B \-u
Print a message whenever the compiler tries to open a file.
.TP
.B \-U
Dump core on E778 as well as printing an error.
.TP
.B \-g
Leave the generated C in place, and make the output executable
debuggable.
.TP
.B \-l
Attempt to report likely bugs and nonportabilities (implies -O).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The newsgroup
.B alt.lang.intercal
is where INTERCAL compilers are announced, and INTERCAL itself is
discussed; the website
.B http://intercal.freeshell.org
is where the most recent versions of C-INTERCAL (and also
CLC-INTERCAL) are currently hosted.
