			NEW IN THIS RELEASE

		Release 0.13 (by Eric S. Raymond)

1. I folded in patches by Brian Raiter <breadbox@muppetlabs.com> that port
   this code to Linux and enable it to use flex.  Note: This version has
   been tested on Linux and SunOS but not yet elsewhere.

		Release 0.12 (by Eric S. Raymond)

1. The code now compiles and runs under Linux, using bison and lex.  It does
   *not* yet work with flex;  C.P. Osborne's patches for 0.11 turned out not
   to be sufficient (at least for flex 2.4.6 under Linux using the -l option).
   See the BUGS list.

2. Note 3 under 0.11 was incorrect.  We're in conformance after all.

3. The politesse check is a little smarter about programs too small to
   conform to the 1/5-to-1/3 criterion.  All the pit programs have been
   checked for conformance.  Also, the politesse error message now tells
   you the offending program's line count.

		Release 0.11 (by Eric S. Raymond)

1. Incorporated changes by Jan-Pieter Cornet <cornet@OTech.fgg.EUR.nl> for
   magical inclusion of the system library.  These address an outstanding bug

   2. (SS) The `system library' should be precompiled and `linked' to user
      written code, at least optionally.  Doing this with the current compiler
      presents a few problems.

   which has accordingly been removed from the BUGS file.  They also fix a
   previously unknown bug; due to a minor oversight in the lexer, it was not
   possible to ABSTAIN FROM WRITING IN or READING OUT.  Jan also contributed
   a test program that demonstrates gerund abstention.

2. Despite the obvious appeal of the idea, and much discussion on
   alt.lang.intercal, I decided *not* to add Klingon; maintaining two parallel
   grammars just so the compiler could support SVO and OSV languages would be
   too painful.  There was also a minor mess near case-sensitivity in the
   digits.  The workaround kluges I was offered instead failed to satisfy.

3. We fess up to a violation of the INTERCAL-72 standard.  That implementation,
   instead of accepting an entire multiple-digit number per line of input,
   expected one digit per *card image* (input line).  It is unclear how 
   INTERCAL-72 programs ever managed to input more than one number.

4. Added patches by C.P.Osborne <boris@ibmpcug.co.uk> to make the lexer work
   using flex, for Linux and BSD/386 support.  I didn't use his error-reporting
   patch, though; instead, I changed the parser to catch errors at logical-line
   level.  I also kept the N in `RESUBNIT'; this is a carefully preserved 
   feature of INTERCAL-72.

5. Volapuk digits are now recognized on input.  TO DO: Recognize Volapuk
   keywords, including gerunds.

		Release 0.10 (by Eric S. Raymond)

1. It is now possible to undo a line-number abstention with a gerund
   reinstatement, or undo a gerund abstention with a line-number 
   reinstatement.  In previous versions, gerund abstention/reinstatements and
   line-number abstention/reinstatements were independent of each other.

2. After release 0.5, I wrote in the TO DO list as follows:
  
   2. (ESR) Input format internationalization -- allow WRITE IN input digits in
     major languages such as Nahuatl, Tagalog, Sanskrit, and Basque.
  
   The twisted loons in the alt.folklore.computers crowd loved this idea,
   and I actually got sent digit lists for Nahuatl, Tagalog, Sanskrit, and
   Basque -- also, Kwakiutl, Georgian, Ojibwe. and Albanian.  I've left
   out Albanian (didn't want to keep track of the dipthong diacritical)
   and Ojibwe (no zero digit).  So: Nahuatl, Tagalog, Sanskrit, Basque,
   Georgian, and Kwakiutl are now supported in addition to English.

3. The THEORY document has been significantly revised.

		Release 0.9 (by Eric S. Raymond)

1. An embarrassing port bug in the INTERCAL skeleton has been fixed

2. Jamie Zawinski's suggestion for an improved E333 error message has
   been accepted.

3. Added and improved documentation for pit programs.

4. The install production in the Makefile now puts lose.h in place
   as well as cesspool.h.

5. You can now set the C compiler to be used as a back end by INTERCAL
   by setting the environment variable CC.  The default is cc.

		Release 0.8 (many hacks on 0.7 by Eric Raymond)

1. A previously undocumented `feature' of the Princeton compiler,
   revealed by Don Woods, is now emulated.  If fewer than 1/5 or more
   than 1/3 of a program's statements contain the qualifier `PLEASE', the
   program is rejected with an entertaining error message.  Programs in pit
   have been hacked to pass the politesse test.

2. The `sample' program now works correctly, thanks to Louis Howell.  Also,
   he has contributed new programs to calculate pi and to search for prime
   numbers.

3. An intercal mode for GNU Emacs is included.  It helps programmers deal with
   the new politesse check by randomly expanding the abbrev "do" to DO PLEASE
   or PLEASE DO about 1/4 of the time.

4. Improvements in code generation for NEXT/RESUME.

5. Fixes to the optimizer; it handles the results of optimized MINGLEs
   correctly now.  Also, added a rewrite rule that checks for the
   equality-test idiom using XOR.

6. The original error messages from the Princeton compiler have been restored.

The documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

		Release 0.7 (by Louis Howell)

In addition to bug fixes, new features in this version include arrays,
character I/O, modified (hopefully improved!) semantics for the COME
FROM statement, extensions to bases other than 2, new INTERCAL programs,
and new documentation.

		Release 0.6 (by Steve Swales)

1. Restored Princeton documentation (courtesy of Michael Ernst).

2. Added -@ usage option to ick.

3. Added [+/-]help, [+/-]traditional, and [+/-]wimpmode options for
generated programs; [+/-]traditional is a no-op at this point.

4. Various bug fixes, esp. in lexical analysis.

		Release 0.5 (ESR's original pre-release)

1. As a convenience to all you junior birdmen out there, `NINER' is accepted as
   a synonym for `NINE' in INTERCAL input.

2. The COME FROM statement is now compiled.
