  The first merged release from ESR and Alex Smith, with encouragement from
  Donald Knuth. The compiler now has a regression-test suite. More error
  checks (E990 and E004) have been added. A new program, guess.i, writhes 
  in the pit. The mystery and history of the "Atari implementation" has
  been clarified. Various minor bugs have been fixed.
